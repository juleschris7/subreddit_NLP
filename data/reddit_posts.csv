I create characters who will die. Why? I think the death is part of all human life. Some of my characters:
-A very old Turtle, who dont do any big thing in the life. But like hear tales and heroes who bring peace. And the end of the life, he want to become the hero in one tale. Dont have fear, he have a good life. Every time Help, without coin or Favor. He is Just a good friend. And he dont know, but he is a hero.
-A sick person. Cant heal out of the sick. He will die soon. So he go adventures and try to build a Better place. Try to catch the joy of life. Every time some body Tell a question he is in. Drunk? YES! Tavern fight? YES! Sex with an orc? No... Not that far. But a person who try live joy, and bond with the party... Inside maybe break, because he need to leave, but always smieling.

I dont have to much character, but i like these. I think my best creations. I like the role play as Well (Turtle who Hard of hearing, have big belly, speak like oogway or a young man who sit down assaide a dosser, Gave him 1000 gold)

Gashinesh is a city of sorts in the middle of a large ocean. Its inhabitants are diverse, and in an effort to keep the peace, the laws are without mercy.

The city is built in the shallows of a submerged island that stretches for miles. During low tide, it is possible for a person to walk on the submerged beaches, as the water is knee-high. During high tide, the water rises a few feet above the average person's head.

The city is built like a deep-sea oil rig. Some parts of the city are floating while being anchored to the surface below. The more established parts of the city are built on stilts made from masts salvaged from shipwrecked ships. Housing, shops, and storage platforms are built, interconnected like a treehouse against these masts. The entire city sways and rocks during a storm and everything of value is tied down.

Walkways are made from rope bridges and rope ladders, and the more unfortunate inhabitants can be seen at night, sleeping in hammocks tied to whatever was available at the time. There are mussels growing on everything that is submerged in water. Staying dry for a whole day while walking the city is almost impossible.

The city’s inhabitants rarely immigrate to Gashinesh by choice, and the city’s population grows almost exclusively from passing ships being pulled into the currents and sinking when their hulls are grated to shreds on the shallow corals. Most drown, but a few survivors do make it to the city before the tide rises.

To the mainlanders, Gashinesh is nothing but a rumor. A story told by people who have lost a loved one at sea, clinging to hope that perhaps their loss isn’t so utterly final. Many people seek the rumored city, as more than one treasure ship has gone missing in the vicinity of where the city is believed to be.

The city has a plethora of fishers, and thanks to the lively coral and kelp fields, there is always enough food available. Fresh drinking water is harder to come by, and dying of thirst isn’t uncommon. Money has no value in Gashinesh, and all trade is through barter only. Fresh bottled water is the preferred currency.

Other than the smell, the constant noise, lack of safety, and prospects of a future, with the right attitude, Gashinesh can be a wonderful place to live. It has the most fantastic sunrises and sunsets. It is a place where you are truly not judged for who you are or what your past was, only now matters.

Basically, I want to make a town that is part of a country, but is so far away from most of the country that it's basically isolated. The town has a tavern, brothel, fletcher, blacksmith (as well as stores to sell those goods), apothecary, and of course farms, guard house, church, and the Lord's manor.

They have mines, but they are occupied by other hostiles.

The bit I'm having trouble with is how does money flow in between them? Obviously the Lord collects taxes from the townspeople, and the Lord pays the guardsmen protecting the town. But someone is going to be more rich than everyone else, plus if donations are given to the church, then the deities of the church will take the money.

Basically, I don't want to resort to ""everyone magically has an unspecified amount of money that never runs out"", especially since I'm gonna eventually have players running that town in an effort to get it back on it's feet.

How can I make it work without being lazy about it?",dnd

It’s set in the steampunk compendium playbook of 5e (I don’t have a link rn but I’ll post it below later). We use a Guild system to swap party members if someone can’t make it, most jobs take 1-3 sessions but there is a building lore and story behind it all. I don’t know every detail the other DM has planned and he doesn’t know everything I do. We also use our own characters to play in an entirely homebrew world.

This system has worked out so great so far and keeps us both from getting burnt on on the campaign. And we’ve created most of the Guild NPC characters together. Including the parties, and our, favorite character: YO’GURT GACKZBY!!! 

To paraphrase our DM notes: He’s a ex-adventurer goblin. He has 3 kids at home and is a single dad widow. He used to be in a throuple but both his partners died tragically while adventuring so he quit the life to make sure he could be there for his kids. 

He makes great fish pies, chili cheese fries, always on time with service, and is respected by everyone in guild. Recently we started making him available outside of the guild (I.e. taking his kids camping, making shopping trips for guild supplies) and im thinking of making an escort mission with him for the players soon. 

The mission will include bringing up the death of his partners and maybe facing off against the creature that killed them. The other DM has 2 more sessions planned to finish out the current arc but November is Yo’gurt Gackzbys month. I’m so excited for this story arc and the players helping Gackzby get the closure he needs.",dnd

>*She had been my companion for many decades, and I always thought I would be the one leaving her behind as she never seemed to age. We could never touch, for we were separated by glass, but that didn’t matter. I don’t know what her voice sounded like. I’m not even sure if she even had a voice. She loved me, I think.

>*A piece of me died in that moment, and the world suddenly seemed filled with despair.*

Lupelirle gems are small, perfectly formed orbs resembling pearls. They are entirely covered with tiny, detailed eldritch etchings and the gem always feels warm when held in one’s hand. They are seemingly impossible to shatter, even when struck with a hammer or dropped from great heights.

The gems are very valuable and rare. The pearlike gem also emits a faint aura of magic, and a soft “shimmering” noise can be heard if pressed close to one’s ear.

When the gem is submerged in water overnight and touched by the rays of a full moon, it dissolves. In its place, a tiny ethereal water nymph is formed.

The nymph is restricted to the body of water where it was “born” and can not move beyond it. Should the water evaporate or disappear through some other means, the nymph also disappears forever.

The nymph forms a strong but silent empathetic bond with the first person it sees after coming into existence. A powerful spiritual bond is formed. As long as this person is within 5 feet of the nymph, they feel calmer and entirely at peace. The world seems brighter, and they have clarity of thought. They also have heightened empathy for all other living beings. This has led individuals that are aware of the gems' true nature, to keep the nymph in a bottle of water that can be worn around one’s neck.

Though they are rare, it is not uncommon for very high ranking diplomats and counselors to wear a bottled nymph on their person. They are also sought after by collectors and mages.

No one is entirely sure how the Lupelirle gems were created. Due to the eldritch etchings on them, it is clear that they aren’t naturally occurring. There are rumors that they are actually eggs from some fae creature. Others believe they were created by a merfolk deity and gifted to land dwellers during peace negotiations. Some believe they are in fact cursed, created by a sinister entity for the sole purpose of causing grief and despair once the nymph inevitably disappears.

Hello guys, I turn to my brilliant brothers and sisters of Reddit in need of clever advice - I am starting a campaign today and the setting is placed in a massive city torn by several factions, races and guilds competing eachother for resources and power. The character's goal is to destroy this system from within - My GM is an incredibly smart individual and I am aware he will not be lenient on me while I attempt to achieve such a task.

Therefore I turn to you, the reader and I ask for advice and ideas on how I should go about it.The character starts as musician in an inn, he has lived in this city his entire life - this was his plan since youth because his family was directly killed because of these faction-conflicts. He waited for the right moment. He starts with 2 contacts (A forger whose a dear friend of his) and another forced contact, a low-ranking individual he is blackmailing that is a member of one of the guilds/factions.

He started as a musician because that will enable him to be at certain places and listen to certain individuals without looking suspicious, later on perhaps joining as a part of a musical display in an important individual's house - essentially granting him access to places he wouldn't otherwise be able to reach.

How would you suggest I should go about it? The goal is to sow discord and conflict whilst attracting as little attention to myself as possible until the time is ripe.

The character is a rogue, we play 5E homebrew.

Main goals are to climb ranks and status within the city and break the factions from within.

He specializes in deception, has something alike to disguise kit, and is familiar with the two most spoken Languages in that world - Common and Elven. Any suggestions or intricate plans or clever idaes are so very welcome and appreciate! Thank you all.

Here's some example questions:

How should I start pitting the factions and guilds against one another?  
How do I gain trust and climb the ranks within one (or more) factions?  
What kind of sources of information do I need to be able to manipulate this chess game effectively and how do I get them?  
How do I keep low profile until I believe I am strong/established enough to reveal my identity and when is that stage?

Any expansions would be greatly appreciated!",dnd

I took some time to think of a reasonable class to alter and here is my result. Please let me know if you think it’s over powered or unbalanced, by the end of it, I thought it was a pretty cool concept.



Martial Archetype Path of the Doctor 

At 2nd level your medical knowledge allows you to identify key pressure points within the human body. Your knowledge of pressure points is equal to your fighter level and replenishes after a long rest.

In replacement of second wind

At level 2

Expend 1 knowledge of pressure points: You learn pressure points that you can focus on to heal yourself or others. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to focus on a pressure point and roll 1d6 to heal one target you can touch. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Pool of pressure points. At 5th level this die increases to 1d8 and at 12 level it increased to 1d10 at 18th level it increases to 1d12. 


Action surge 

Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn

Starting at 3rd level 
As an action you make a blue dome appear, centered on you, and encompasses everything within a 5ft radius. The dome lasts for 1 minute or until dispelled. The dome remains in the place it was cast and does not follow you. You may dispel the room as a bonus action on your turn. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. 

While inside the dome you can activate one of the following abilities as a bonus action on your turn.

Shambles: You choose a target creature that you can see of equal or lessor size and swap positions within the room. You may alternatively choose an object that you can see weighing no more than 200lbs and swap places with it.

Tact: you target 1 creature of equal or less size, it must make a Wisdom Saving throw vs your DC (8+prof+intelligence) On a failure the target is lifted 10 ft into the air and is considered restrained. Alternatively you may target an object weighing no more than 200lbs  and lift it 10ft in the air

Amputate: While inside your room your next attack deals an extra 1d6 slashing damage

At 9th level this affect expands to a 10ft radius centered on you, at 15th level the room expands to a 15ft radius centered on you.

Ability score improvement 

When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 14th level in this class.

At 5th level

Haki

As a bonus action on your turn you can focus on a number of pressure points within your body to achieve one of the following effects per turn.

Busoshoku: 3 pressure points Your AC increases by 2 for 1 minute.

Kenbunshoku: 2 pressure points Your next attack has advantage

Haoshoku: 4 Pressure points Until the start of your next turn you have advantage on saving throws",dnd

I haven't seen D&D since really the version I was using in the nineties (was that version 4?!?)

What is the best entrance for under-10?  How much am I going to need to budget for this so I can run it past the wife for approval.  They're both good readers, for being 6, and I think this is a great opportunity for my family to do something together as Winter and COVID lock us down further.  I have written a series of short stories while they were younger, ""The Stories of Gabriel the Great (Wizard) and Theodore the True (Knight)) and I read them and they read a ton of fantasy.

Does Basic D&D even exist anymore?  Are there other similar games that maybe I should look at?  Again, I have to sell this budget to the wife.

So...I'm m not sure if this has been done but with the recent release of the Icewind Dale book and the pandemic, I'm thinking this could be a cool idea. I've always enjoyed The Thing and the idea that there could be infected among players and eventually the players turning against one other. The hook/hooks are as follows:

The party is tasked to check out a remote outpost in the frigid mountains to see why the outpost hasn't responded.

The party is given a task to travel to a town and in the process, they travel through the mountains and come across the outpost as it is being infected.

The party is hired to deliver supplies to the outpost and they run across the previous caravan of supplies totally destroyed. They find someone who is wounded or am animal that is infected. 

The idea is the party would be blamed almost immediately. Or become immediately suspected due to *Insert random event* 

What I'm stuck on is what kind of creature would do this/really fit the tone of the campaign. An eldritch horror? Perhaps a newly discovered plant fungus? Some ancient race of doppelganger woken up? The goal of the big bad will be to infect everyone. I've been looking for a real RP driven campaign and I feel like this could be a lot of fun. How does a player become infected? Is there a cure? 

 My fellow DM's, players and needs, could I ask what your thoughts are on this? How could I improve this? How could I make certain events make the other players distrust one another without railroading the story? Any tips would be greatly appreciated.",dnd

So basically I’m moving away for uni and I want to dm one last epic conclusion to our 2,5 years long campaign

while I’ll be very ok with building encounters dangerous enough for the characters to risk death, I’d like to plan the game’s logistics so that the players don’t have to

We’re already working on setting up a “game table” that will be a circle of individual chair+table setups in an open-air private park. I’m happy with this solution because it will allow for a basically no-risk scenario since everyone will be far from each other and wearing a mask, but at the same time I am very worried about it being very distracting and difficult from a gaming perspective.

I have always put much effort into the “experience” aspect of this game. We have one specific scented candle that’s always lit when we play (it “smells like D&D” now), I have a lamp that changes color to set the mood, heavy use of props... So my players are used to a synesthetic type of engagement. In a normal condition, this last session would have been the fireworks level one (you know, now that I write fireworks....)

The session will basically be “the last fight of course of strahd but set throughout the whole city of waterdeep”, I’m planning on it being a long fight spanning trough several areas and involving several non-combat moments with potential allies, puzzles, difficulties all while the bbeg (and their allies, since they control the whole city) is going all out on them.

I’m thinking that making the weirdness of this setup central in the design of the experience might be the best idea. I’m thinking maybe finding a paved area and draw a giant map with chalk? Having them light lanterns at some point?

One idea that I have is having them physically divided in smaller groups (oh yeah, I have nine players) acting in different parts of the city with me running around like and idiot while they complete separate challenges (and, hear me out, use those lanterns/fireworks to signal each other). I can maybe get two other dms to help me with this.

Any ideas on how to make this fun? Help me make this an afternoon they will remember!",dnd

As a disclaimer, you should know your group and your game to decide if this is useful and if it’s something they’d enjoy.

If you’ve never been to an escape room, the basic idea is that there are clues hidden around the room that will eventually, if the puzzles are solved, enable you to escape.  Each clue will lead to the next in some manner—it may open a box with the next clue, it may have a message written on it, etc.

So, in my last campaign, there was a quirky and strange wizard type in a secluded tower who would periodically offer the PCs to solve puzzles for rewards because he’s a quirky and strange wizard type and sometimes that’s what they do.  In reality, it was a way for the players to get to enjoy puzzles if that’s what they wanted to do without the obligation of having to solve them to advance the story.

At the time we were playing in a garage with all the typical garage stuff lining the walls.  I’d taken pictures of the various items surreptitiously and constructed clues that would lead them to some of the things throughout the room where new puzzles and answers were waiting.  The players slowly accumulated four digits to open the lock on the chest containing their reward.

My players really enjoyed it and still talk about it from time to time over two years later.  It’s been brought up that they’d like to do it again but we’ve since moved into our host’s kitchen and I just don’t want to send people rifling through his stuff looking for clues.

For this to work your players will have to suspend the desire for realism for a bit and forget about game mechanics.  My players weren’t rolling perception checks or investigation checks, they were moving around the real world environment and using their own perception and intellectual faculties regardless of character stats.  You may incorporate a mechanic to allow them to get hints based on rolls a limited number of times or (like escapes rooms do) simply give them a limited number of hints that they can request.  When it was all done it was just said that they’d solved his puzzle and been rewarded because it didn’t matter what the puzzle was and we weren’t going to say that the characters were magically teleported to a 21st century garage on Earth.

175,Got some ideas? 5e Genie Patron Warlock,2,ja8ocj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonsAndDragons/comments/ja8ocj/got_some_ideas_5e_genie_patron_warlock/,1,1602602686.0,"Sorry for the long post! I love to explain my current campaigns going on and hope you enjoy a small story and the ability to add your input to a character's creation. :)

I'm going to be creating a Genie Patron Warlock for an upcoming session with me and my boyfriend and some friends, with me as the DM. It is a campaign set mainly in the Forgotten Realms and the Shadowfell (also have been jumping to different planes occasionally) and has a lot to do with Mind Flayers. (NOTE: I already get the thing about DMPC's, but all my payers asked if I could make a character and not just an NPC that can just die at the drop of a hat and that can improve with the party. I liked the idea and this was the easiest way to execute it).

My boyfriend's character character, Griff the Soulknife Rogue (failed victim of Ceremorphosis), met my friend's Dragonborn Paladin at the Yawning Portal in Waterdeep and they got to talking and sharing about themselves; Griff spoke of his imprisonment by a Mind Flayer and the seven greusome days of the process to make him one of their own, while the Paladin talked about his devotion to his deity (who my friend honestly hasn't decided on yet, but players it off well in RP). The character I want to build is friends with the Paladin and walked up to them to also make conversation. The party's Changeling Bard got upon the stage and started leading the tavern in a sing-along, so the rest moved to another table to talk (and hear). They talked about Undermountain and Mind Flayers and decided to team up to root out one who had moved into the massive dungeon (it having the goal to prey on the weaker inhabitants like goblins and other humanoids to replace their brains with Intellect Devourers).

I don't have build ideas/goals picked out for my Warlock yet because I want to get his Race/Background/Personality down first, because he will be good for the party no matter what specialization I choose. I did describe him as ""seemingly human by what you can tell, waering common clothes (could not think of what to choose at the spur of the moment so I made it neutral) and a pleasant expression"".

So, challenge time, y'all! What do you think? (Please don't say its up to me, because I am just asking for your ideas on what ideas you guys had). I have yet to decide on:

- Race ideas?

- Background ideas?

- Djinni, Efreet, Marid or Dao?

- How did they became a Warlock of said Genie?

- Ideas on how the vessel looks? (I don't want to use the suggestions from the book. I might wanna use him in the future, so I wanna make him really original. But, Dao to me could be a long crystal or a geode which is the same color as his patrons skin or magic. Efreeti could be a classic lamp made of brass and it's always almost too warm when inside. Marid might be a pearl or a blue vase-type thing that echoes with the calming sound of flowing water? Djinni I have no clue on. Maybe some kind of chime or shaped and colored glass sculpture? Idk).


(Already considered each Genasi with each of the four patrons and how that could kinda work, backstory-wise. Big maybe with favor toward Air Genasi.

Speaking of which, any interesting backstory and/or physical features if he were any Genasi beholden to a Genie from his elemental opposite? (Maybe earth Genasi with Djinni patron has cracks in skin or looks like he is almost  ""mid-Thanos Snap™"" when he casts spells. Fire Genasi with Marid parton always giving off a slight sizzle, only faintly perceptible or is giving of a light steam.)



TL;DR: Making a DMPC Genie Warlock for Campaign with boyfriend and friends and would love some input on how you might build a character like this.

187,Why I’m leaving my group,1,ja55fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonsAndDragons/comments/ja55fo/why_im_leaving_my_group/,7,1602586270.0,"There could be a lot of stories here so I’ll just list various things each person of my group has done to give you an idea what I’m dealing with and why I’ve finally become so frustrated that I’m leaving.

First person, we’ll call them John:
-incredibly stoned all the time.  This will be true of 3/4 of the others in my group.
-as DM, will stop and read through a section of the module he’s running for minutes at a time to come up with an answer to a question or action because he’s too lazy to prepare ahead of time and won’t simply adjudicate an outcome.
-as DM, will spend several minutes pointing from across the DM screen and trying to describe a room to one of the players so that they can draw it on the map instead of standing up, walking around the screen, and drawing it himself.  He will do the same when describing movement of miniatures on the grid.
-as DM, has read out loud the flavor text for an RP encounter saying that there is a riot in which guards are throwing back a large crowd of locals and then looked up from the text he just read to say, “so, the captain is out in front of the gate speaking to a couple townsfolk and, seeing you, begins walking your way.”  I actually stopped him and said, “wait, what happened to the riot?”  He looked at me in silence for a moment or two and said, “what riot?”  To which I responded, “dude, you literally just read it out loud to us.”  I cannot stress to you guys how much I am not making this up.  It actually happened.  I swear to Bahamut.
-as DM, will not provide any useful information regardless of who you talk to or what research you do but will take over an hour of real life time of you in the largest library on the continent with their personnel acting as a research assistants for you to not have found anything useful.  We also went to a village that was attacked by demons 50 years ago and, despite some people who witnessed it still being alive, no one had any information on what happened that night.  No legends, no stories, and (I cannot stress this enough) no first-hand accounts from the living witnesses with all their mental faculties intact and no obscuring magic covering the event.
-home brewed a campaign in which two of the players came from an isolated village with no contact with the outside world.  When they asked how far away from the city we were in, they were told it was a four hour walk.  This village is mere miles from one of the largest cities on the continent and neither the city nor the village knew about the other.  The village was even in the mountains so they could see the city.
-is tactically uninspired as DM.  If a creature has flying, you better believe it will never fly and it will be a simple, straight forward smack fight.  Bad guys will inexplicably start to shift their attacks away from weakened players too.  If someone is dying, there will often be a deus ex machina to save them.  I have never felt challenged by an encounter with him as DM.
-as a player proceeded to watch the last bad guy from an encounter escape into a cavern complex and then plopped down at the entrance to ritual cast Tiny Hut.  The rest of the party just stood there as he did it.  I promptly had more bandits from inside the caves come out to fight them.  After finally beating them and being completely tapped on spell slots he does the exact same thing 50 ft from the cave entrance after one of the bandits had turned invisible and was unaccounted for.  This turned into a TPK.

Second person, we’ll call her Kathryn
-is another of the incredibly stoned people
-will always forget everything.  Can’t remember if she’s using a rapier or a scimitar despite the fact that she has been using the exact same weapon the entire time (months for this campaign).  She will do something like flank to give herself advantage, note out loud that she is in flanking position, and then roll to attack, at which point someone will annoyedly have to remind her that she just gave herself advantage.
-has played mostly casters since she’s been playing D&D (weekly for the last two years) and has inexplicably in the past month tried to cast silence as a reaction and tried to use mage hand as a reaction to catch a harpoon.
-stabbed a guy in a crowd of his friends in an effort to recover an item and got mad when we let her get almost killed without helping.  The DM jumped in to save her from her stupidity because it’s his wife.  She did it again within 10 minutes and got mad that we didn’t save her again.
-plays a face character but in a recent RP session she, I shit you not, having forgotten what she was supposed to say simply asked the DM to skip this and move on.  She wanted to just fast forward the having to talk part because it was too hard.
-despite nearly always having bless from me for the first several levels of the campaign, could not ever remember what it did.
-inexplicably thought the party’s fighter was a halfling.  We have been playing this particular campaign weekly for over six months.  This character has never changed.  We’ve continually called him the orc or the half-orc (as he is a half-orc) and he was described as stereotypically huge and brutish but for some reason two sessions ago she said something about looking down at him and when asked how tall she thought he was she said she thought he was a halfling.  I have no clue what the hell she has been hearing this entire time.

Third person, we’ll call Kevin
-actually not stoned
-his idea of RP is that his character always goes to the bar to avoid RP.
-despite having played weekly for the last year,  still doesn’t know the difference between a save and a check.
-despite nearly always having bless from me for the first several levels of the campaign, could not ever remember what it did.
-had a habit for several sessions of saying “it’s gonna miss” every time the DM declared a monster attacked him.  If the monster hit he would continue the same tired joke of saying “that misses” and still think it was funny.
-goes from his character speaking in broken English to full sentences to a Russian or German accent for some reason randomly.
-can be trusted to forget the simplest of plans and do the exact opposite.  On multiple occasions he’s agreed to a plan of staying at range to fight only to run up and engage on his very first turn and destroy the plan.

Finally, and least annoyingly, we’ll call this one Connor
-incredibly stoned all the time
-can be trusted to play every character like a straight forward fighter.  He will not use his paladin’s spells, smites, or other special abilities for reasons outlined in the next bullet.
-almost never uses an expendable resource that he gets back after a rest.  He does this because he’s afraid he’ll want them for the next fight so this just turns into never using them.  He also often forgets that he has certain abilities so he never uses them.
-kept a magic item for months and never used it despite prompting because he didn’t feel like he ever needed it.  I finally told him I’d take it if he didn’t want it (I’d originally insisted he take it because I get a lot of enjoyment out of trying to get the other characters to shine).  He gave it to me and I quickly became the most powerful character in the group.  I’m intentionally being vague to avoid spoilers for a module.
-told the entire party about this secret room his commander had (his background was as a guard) and how he thinks the item we’re looking for is in there.  We start formulating a plan about how we’ll get into it and find the item.  The DM finally stopped him to clarify that this room didn’t exist and he didn’t know where this idea came from.
-will simply do nothing on his turn sometimes.  Sometimes for multiple turns in a row.  He does this frequently any time there’s something more complicated than a monster within his range to walk to and attack.",dnd

It serves as kind of a whirlwind tour of some important locations in the Crossroads, before heading underground to the titular location.  


Like Tales of the Old Margreve, there is an extensive amount of sourcebook material for the location as well.

Having someone who excels at the war gaming aspect of DnD strengthens your parties fighting abilities, and therefore increases the number and danger level of creatures you can fight. This is beneficial because it inherently adds more fear and drama to the game. Additionally, if your power gamer is in a support role (which I think is the best role for a power gamer), your less tactically inclined players will feel loved when the power game buffs them, protects them, and nerfs their enemies. Plus, your non power gamers will get the opportunity to win dramatic fights they might otherwise lose, which increases their own feelings of power. 

I think the real major issue is when power gamers refuse to roleplay. They change the feeling at the table and can create a negative experience for other players, particularly if they get frustrated with other players decisions or try to backseat game.",dnd

As mentioned i am a first time DM and am also fairly new to DnD in a whole. I have played as a PC in a couple of campaigns but only ever for one or two sessions due to living so far from my friends that play.  However i am a long time RPG/MMO/Boardgame player AKA Nerd. My first session is this weekend so trying to be as well prepared as possible :D

I am expecting alot of you to say i should just run a premade campaign for my first time but i have always been someone who likes a challenge and have decided to create my own world using a classic fantasy backdrop.

I would appreciate any tips or opinions you may have on my current campaign as i want to make it a good experiance for everyone involved. I believe i should have no major issues with rules etc but i understand there may be things i haven't thought about yet.

Below is the introduction to the campaign that i have sent to each of my players for them to reference in their backstories.

&#x200B;

Campaign Intro

Arundal is a small nation of the Church of Waukeen situated on the east coast of Guidell with the far stretching Runger mountains to their west. To their north is the Jagrek Forest, a Goblin and Orc hunting ground with the Orc Homelands of Geldrek past that. To the South is Firemourne the envy of many of the other nations for their wealth and immense military strength.

Formerly a very poor nation Arundal's luck has started to change with trade deals opening up with Firemourne. Meanwhile many Goblins who have been exiled from Geldrek for worshiping Loviatar. These goblins have traveled further south settling in Arundal and have been causing trouble.

Our adventurers after hearing of the troubles in Arundal have made their way to Claymore, the Capital of Arundal with the intention of making a name for themselves.

&#x200B;

I have a google doc with Locations and Organisations and NPC's that i plan to use, along with brief explanations of how i expect them to look, act or what information they would have available. 

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pX81M3SebA\_BvtaQOVx3JGCy2EwV4SUfIU89Qz8Hw0Y/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pX81M3SebA_BvtaQOVx3JGCy2EwV4SUfIU89Qz8Hw0Y/edit?usp=sharing)

The doc is open for comments so feel free to do that if you take a look at it. :D

&#x200B;

Currently i have x2 Fighters x1 Rogue x1 Paladin x1 Ranger and one more player who is yet to decide on their class/background. i have been feeding each player small bits of information about the world that their character would know about. 

some issues or bits i have already noticed need work.

\- Too many kill quests (have thorght about adding prisoners to a senario in attempt to push a bigger story line)

\- Finding the main story (After having some of my players backgrounds back it looks like a classic overthrow the current king senario may be happening in Arundal)

\- How certain npc's react to my PC's (e.g. one of my PC's is a wanted man and would be known to some NPC's (Merchants) in the capital.

&#x200B;

References and tools i plan to use to run the campaign.

Most of my party members are totally on board... except for the two (not-so-secretly) CE Yuan-tis, whose main goal is to enslave as many people as possible to take back to their queen as sacrifices.

So far, they've won one person's servitude in a bet. Adamo, their new slave, helps them in battle whenever they need him. However, their first taste of victory has them hungry for more. They need more slaves.

So I have devised a system. They have this cool necklace granted to them by a shady goblin necromancer named Schmebulock. It's called the Schmebulocket. Basically, the locket can hold up to five souls. Should they ""convert"" any more innocent NPCs, their soul goes in the locket and a character sheet is made. They can bring out one soul per battle as an action and control them on their own initiative.

And, uh, they may have run across an illegal ""dogfighting ring"" where other Yuan-tis battle their slaves for sport... bringing the souls out of the locket to fight each other gladiator-style... and oh god, my campaign sounds like a somehow more fucked up Pokemon now.

I'm not sure how it got to be this far, but now I'm invested (and so are they, much to the relative misfortune of the other party members who now have to deal with slave combat). I'm working on a surprise ""trading system"" among the Yuan-tis, where they can give up a weak slave to get a fun random one in return.

Don't worry, though. My other players are getting equal treatment as well. For example, my druid got herself a personal assistant recently (not a slave, but her god's personal secretary sent down to her in sprite form). And our paladin is trying to find an NPC he's not desperately in love with---he has simped for a prostitute, a princess, and a carny, respectively.

However i understand that the sword plays a major role in the Avernus module and im concerned that my character being in position of it (even if unknowingly) would put a huge awkward wrench into the campaign for the DM to deal with if my group decided to run it.

>*I watched in horror as my entire regiment was slaughtered before me in the dark. The screaming devils vanished and reappeared with flashes in the blackness. Each flash of displacement added to the confusion and disorientation of my men. As the devils reached the light of our torches, their dark-skinned numbers were much higher than we had anticipated.*  
>  
>*Had the slaughter not been so horrifying, the skill and precision of their actions would have mesmerized any mere mortal. I watched as they leaped, twirled, and danced through my stunned regiment, their flashing blades painting a scarlet masterpiece with the spurting blood spatter of my fallen comrades.*

The Tawyajni fungus only grows in dark, damp caverns and forest floors where there is rarely any movement or airflow to disturb it.

The fungus grows like moss on the floors and will sprout thin tendrils up to 4 feet high. A small bulb-like bubble grows at the tips of these tendrils, seemingly floating in the air.

What makes this fungus interesting is its bioluminescence properties. When disturbed by airflow or movement, the bulblike bubbles light up, glowing neon- blue, purple, or green until it fades back into darkness when the movement stops.

The fungus forms an integral park in Tawyajni culture. The Tawyajni elves harvest the small bulbs and use them to create body paint used in several of their rituals.

In combat, the elves use this body paint to paint tribal motifs on their bodies to intimidate their opponents. They will hide in ambush until their opponent is close enough, and then spring forth from the darkness, armed with cruel, dark steel blades.

Their assault is carefully choreographed, with the elves acting in groups of 3. One elf would dart forward, causing their luminescent body paint to light up, and then disappear into darkness again when they come to a sudden stop. Another two elves will then dash forward, lighting up, only to suddenly stop again. The stop-dash pattern seems random, but is well planned and practiced to achieve the maximum level of disorientation and discomfort to the enemy.

To the opponent, it seems like only a few elves are charging while teleporting backward, forwards, left and right until the horde is close enough to flash a blade ripping through their flesh.

During marriage rituals the bodypaint is used to recreate enchanting dance routines performed in the darkness, flashing and disappearing in the darkness.

Another little known fact to outsiders is that Tawyajni fungus can be chewed to create powerful hallucinogenic visions. It is traditional for tribal members to partake in the chewing of the fungus before watching any of the recreational dances.

It was from an earlier edition, Im pretty sure 1e or 2e, I think it was from a third-party company. It had two pregenerated characters, a Druid and a Ranger. They started the adventure captured by a warlock (their former party member who was being controlled by a magic helmet), the players start naked and chained up on a wall and the goal was for them to complete the dungeon by escaping and/or tracking down their former party member the warlock and getting the helmet off of him.

The timer was set to only 1 hour and there was a scorecard at the end to judge how well the players did based on avoiding unnecessary fight and making in character decisions (example - the druid being afraid of cramped spaces would be penalized points if he went through a tight dark corridor). There were a couple Gas Spores, a Rhinoceros Beetle (the players could earn 10 points if they threw paint in it's eyes), and a mirror on the wall near the end (with a copy of Alice in Wonderland on a chair nearby as a hint to go through the mirror).

He has short white hair, light tanned skin, golden eyes, is about 6'5"" and medium build. the wings that come with the aasimar race are slightly different to most as they relect both sides of his blood, with the wings taking on the bird/feathered look from the aasimar side of his blood but take the colourization of Gold Dragon's wings.

Instead of a sword for thier pact weapon, he uses a uses a longbow.

268,D&D scenario: What would you have done?,1,j9al2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonsAndDragons/comments/j9al2e/dd_scenario_what_would_you_have_done/,2,1602469623.0,"Hi all - first time poster, so sorry in advance for any faux pas I make. I just got back into D&D during the quarantine. I hadn't played since I was a kid, 2e, and its been fun. Until last night. I'm in two campaigns, this one with a first time player, and our DM thew a scenario at us which I didn't expect to survive, and I don't know what I should have done differently. I am posting here to get other's thoughts on how they would have handled it differently (e.g. better).

First, about our party. We have (5) 7th level characters: a Bard, a Barbarian, a Rogue (who just started dual-classing as a fighter) and (2) Clerics. I won't bore you with the details of how we ended up with these characters. We were on a quest, to kill someone who almost wiped us out when we were level 5. On the way, we got intercepted by a Green Dragon (we weren't sure the age, but we believe they were an adult). The Green Dragon ordered us, under pain of death, to go on a quest for him in another direction, to help him kill a Black Dragon (we didn't know the age). I didn't think we are up to fighting dragons; however, both the direction we wanted to go (West) and the direction of the Black Dragon (East) were in open terrain, and both were several days walk (3-4 to the West, 5 to the East). My memory on Dragons was they would spot us if we deviated off the path. Also, we only had one decent ranged fighter, so I didn't like our chances in open terrain, so I felt that we had to go East towards Mr. Black in his cave.

My only thought for how we might survive this is to try to convince the Black Dragon we were being forced here by Green, and that we would help Black kill Green. We were going in the cave first, where we encountered some Gnolls. The Bard was able to communicate with the Gnolls in a language the Green dragon didn't understand (or didn't appear to), and made a huge, big-boy persuasion roll (29 with bonuses), but it didn't work. Black went on the attack. Green did come in to fight with us, and someone we survived (I think the DM took mercy on us as the end). As the fight was about to start, the DM says, ""this is not at all what I expected to happen"" which begs the question, what should we have done differently.

I pushed him for an answer; what should we have done, but he wouldn't say. So, I'm coming here to hear how other players would have handled this.

PS We ended the session with all of us badly injured, low on spells, and in a cave with a slightly injured Green Dragon. The other player and I are thinking of attacking the Green dragon as we don't trust Green to let us go, and right now, they are injured too. It may be our best chance, or just another bad move in a series of bad moves.",dnd

3rd pc: Coalette the way of the astral self monk, focused on unarmed.

basically why we ended up in a party like this was, I made a kobold artificer battle smith, one of the players roled for race, she got kobold and picked bloodhunter for concept, and third one wanted a challenge, so she picked kobold as a way to make it harder... unsure on if three kobolds with a setup like ours will do well.

Will we end up being a strong party? or a weak party? Just wondering if our party will have a good balance, or not.

**Context:**

My friend is running this episodic campaign, where about 20 players participate and can 'sign up' for a 3-4 session long adventure. We're typically 4-6 players on an adventure. The whole thing works pretty well, with the DM just posting that a new adventure is ready and people can sign up. It is somewhat inspired by West Marches, which you may or may not know... It results in high diversity in characters and an evershifting cast of adventurers. I also wanna preface the story by saying I wholeheartedly like playing with all the involved players. The whole thing is in 4e, but that is less relevant to the story :-)

I am soliciting opinions and debate about what I did, hoping to form a more solid opinion of my own, based on all your input :-)

&#x200B;

**Storytime:**

character introducs:

Gor Ka'Ruuk: That's me, an orcish shaman from a tribe. Spiritual leader and warrior. Lawful neutral. I was loosely inspired by Thrall and Saurfang from Warcraft lore...

Orcish pirate(let's just call him the pirate): Some fighting type chaotic pirate orc.

Goliath Brawler(let's just call her the monk): Some brawling type of chaotic criminal goliath.

There was a 4th char but she was less important to the story, I'll refer to the brawler and the pirate collectively as the pair.

Ka'Ruuk didn't know any of the other characters when the adventure starts, he'd only just arrived from his tribe in the small settlement where it all started. Here he'd learned that a bunch of slaad were holding orcish slaves in a camp they'd set up near the settlement. The adventure had us go out to free the slaves and kill the invading slaad. I'll spare you the details, suffice it to say that we succeeded. During the whole thing, the pair did a few questionable things. The pirate cut down a slave that thought to run rather than fight it's oppressors once we'd freed them, and the monk sucker punched my character right in the face the first time we had a small disagreement. This was all well and good, it felt right, the pirate being that kind of harsh leader and the monk being a dishonest type and all. My character was quite out of place being as honorable as he is :-)

When we'd finished the last fight something happened. The pair had traded one of the people we'd rescued for an item. This NPC had fought with us against the slaad and been helpful. After the trade, the pair figured they wanted their thing back... So they murdered the NPC. They just pushed him down a large whole (deep within the whole, we'd fought the final boss of the scenario).

My character was near the bottom of the whole, and didn't see the pair push the NPC, but he saw the NPC land and die. He also heard the monk make a highly sarcastic ""whoopsie"" in a silly innocent voice. The pair immediately climbed down the whole and began looting the poor bugger. They also failed their bluff-checks to appear innocent...

IDK I just couldn't ignore blatant and dishonest murder like that, so since we've no formal ""no PvP"" rule, I attacked them. My character was hurt, from the final battle, down to 5 HP so I figured the pair would just knock me out and that'd be that. Worst case scenario they'd kill my character but I would be OK with it because it'd have been right.

I accidentally handed them their asses. 2V1 and I was at a HP disadvantage and I still beat them... When they were both making death saves, my character saved them with a healer's kit and dragged them out of the hazard zone. Then I made my way back to the settlement and reported their crimes to authorities.

Since the settlement was way out of civilisation and stuff, the pair was let go with a warning (they made up a story about it being just revenge but that was a lie)

&#x200B;

In my 10 years of playing D&D, this is the first time I've felt like PvP was the way to go.

&#x200B;

For the record: The monk player loved it. She was all about that meaningful character interaction. The pirate approved, because he cares that things happen 'the right way' but I could tell he was panicking and a little uncomfortable while it was happening. His character was in real danger of dying afterall, and he packed his things while the encounter was still happening (I mean this was the final minutes of the session and he had to go home, but the rest of us were waiting for the session to be called over by the DM...)

What do you guys think? I did ask my DM after the game if he thought I was out of line and he just told me that *in this particular* case, the PvP hadn't ruined the game so it was OK.

&#x200B;

**Tl;Dr:**

My murder-hobo friends commit a greedy murder. So I attacked them with lethal force then bandaged them up and reported their crimes to local authorities. It was not how they pictured the last 15 minutes of the session to pan out...

EDIT: further elaborated the pirate player's reaction.",dnd

300,"Talking Time: pacing, length, and time of play throughout D&D.",2,j8x6h2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonsAndDragons/comments/j8x6h2/talking_time_pacing_length_and_time_of_play/,0,1602411348.0,"I was taken by a thought of how to possibly measure the experience of playing D&D throughout all editions. I would imagine a lot of modern game theory and design has had a drastic impact on how people experience, play and imagine a typical ""D&D Session"" to be like.

More-so, with the recognition of the game's culture, mythos, history, and habits, I'm wondering if this time-measurement could be beyond anecdotally. 

What I'm getting at is, how have modern forms of games (video games, interactive movies, mobile gaming, epic board gaming, mmorpg-ing, etc.) and I'd even throw in modern cultural influences like (lengths of cut in movies, lengths of attention spans for videos v streams v stream of D&D, etc) and how all of this has influenced the expectation of a ""typical D&D Session"".

I contemplate all of this contrasted against my own experience from late Middle school (2002) to playing 5e today (off-line, online, in-person, digitally, a podcast version, a not podcast version, etc) and see my own tolerance, tastes, and thanks for certain changes, developments, understandings, utilizations, etc. For example, I notice in the Adventurer's League campaign ""Oracle of War"", there is a use of time (this section should take 30 minutes, etc) and I'm surprised has not been a part of adventure design in the past. I understand AL is convention/store/pop-in/pop-out type of play, so is structured around a certain understanding. I just imagine the encouragement, or at least structural understanding of a DM/Player experience (fun execution/stimulated enjoyment) would be orchestrated better, or at least somewhat predictably. i.e. when an adventure runs more like a traditional movie script than a resource guide, I, as a DM, feel way more prepared and able to execute, than if I had more encyclopedic knowledge of the world or pages of text that may not be important.

I am also wondering what people are willing to tolerate as players (online or offline) in terms of pacing of a session. With VTTs and the ever growing mini 3D printer hobby, is there an expectation to have more? And the willingness to wait (or not) to set it up? I also am really intrigued by the idea that my efforts could be compounded online if I take time and effort to develop a VTT that could easily be reused, versus setting up minis in real-life each time, or the players boredom with the set up time etc.

Yes, I can recall the glorious 'all nighters' we used to pull in High-school, especially considering we played in the basement of a Deaf household, so we could play as loud as we wanted, but I'm now glad to be able to pull off a significant chunk of an adventure in about an hour or so, without any commute time thanks to D&D on Zoom. That could be my taste in games changing, too. Less 'war game-y' and more 'storytime with friends', has this changed in culture from the 70s to now? In my limited experience, I would say 'Yes' and I want to say a lot has been gained from it. I'm looking forward to the ways in which future growth will happen, and in what ways will the pacing, length, and time of play change throughout D&D.",dnd

It was an interesting thought experiment, but I realized that what that trilogy lacks is a good example of a multi-step complex puzzle, something that your players will have to work together to solve in stages. For that, I would need to turn to one of my favorite game shows: *Survivor*.

Even if you’ve never watched it, you’re probably familiar with the show, if only in passing. For the uninitiated, *Survivor* pits sixteen to twenty individuals against each other in a series of challenges over 39 days with very little food, water, or shelter in a quest to crown one million-dollar winner. After watching more seasons than I care to count in the last three months, I realized that it is the perfect show to watch if you want to learn about complex puzzles.

That doesn’t mean that I think that *Survivor* has the *best* complex puzzles on television. In fact, I often think that they’re too complicated for their own good. That said, I think that there is a lot to be gained from examining both what the show gets right in its design and what it gets wrong.

What follows are some general principles that I’ve gleaned from watching objectively too many episodes of this incredibly messy and entertaining show.

So the spell thorn whip has a pull effect for when creatures are Large or smaller. When I look up the different sizes than there is a section for Large and Small. Not really the same as smaller. 

So I'm playing a medium sized druid. Does this mean I can pull anything that is bigger of smaller than me or can I just pull the Large en Small creatures?

Then last night, the part was fighting a demon that had a bunch of soulless bodies that it could jump between and possess. Well, I decided it would be better not to let it have the various bodies, and figured my character would think it better to be dead than possessed. So I had him start destroying the bodies (not realizing they were still alive). Well, the DM and I decided this act would be the final straw, and the deity took away it's power from the paladin, and he basically called her an evil hypocrite and that he didn't want anything to do with her. He is now Lawful Neutral (since he isn't sure what is good or evil anymore) and has no Paladin powers at the moment. 

All that said, I think that rather than try to work it out with the deity or choose a new one, I want to go oathbreaker paladin, but I don't want to derail the campaign by going full evil. Is this doable, and if so how could I go about playing it?",dnd

We are an up and coming tabletop rpg channel on twitch and youtube. Our goal is two-fold: to provide an entertaining adventure series through our People’s Ascension D&D 5e campaign series, and to further the growth and enjoyment of the ttrpg hobby as a whole through our soon to come Behind The Screens series. The debut episode of our titular campaign will be this Saturday (10/10/20) at 2pm eastern on [twitch.tv/thepeoplesascension](https://www.twitch.tv/thepeoplesascension/about). Our story begins a year after our adventurers first met, with a recap of the previous years’ adventures. From there, this band of 8th level adventurers will continue their mission to seek out injustice and create a better, safer tomorrow for the people of the Jenavian Empire.

This story takes place in a unique campaign setting of my design, outfitted with all the amenities of a real, vibrant world, including: A regional map roughly the size of Europe, with further inaccessible, but nonetheless potentially relevant lands off the map; a sprawling empire filled with history and political intrigue; several distinct provincial cultures; a main imperial religion, as well as regional and racial religions; a complete calendar; and several potentially world shaping entities scheming in the background. With your support, as the channel grows, more information on the world, its peoples, politics, and religions will be released. I hope you’ll join us as we continue to explore this vast vibrant setting. In the coming weeks we will also begin our Behind The Screens series. This series will address commonly asked questions about tabletop roleplay gaming with an emphasis on both sides of the screen. Whether you’re new to the hobby or a veteran adventurer; whether you’re a forever GM or a max level hero, I believe there is always more you can learn from examining new perspectives. In addition to general player and GM advise, this series will tie into our campaign series, at times, with actual behind the screens peeks at my planning and prepping process. Finally, my hope is to eventually address more impactful qualities of roleplay gaming, such as its effect on emotional and mental health, ways of bringing people together, and the educational value of interactive, cooperative storytelling. More on that in the future.

If this at all piques your interest, I invite you to join us every Saturday at 2pm eastern on [twitch.tv/thepeoplesascension](https://www.twitch.tv/thepeoplesascension/about), and to visit our [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDroiXexIveP6AYOOMAaHkw?view_as=subscriber) channel in the coming weeks to catch up on any missed episodes and watch out for our first Behind The Screens video. Moreover, if you find our cause just and our quests worthy, consider joining our community on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/thepeoplesascension), where monthly support will soon unlock a number of exciting features, content, and increased access to the myself, my creative process, and the cast of the show.

I hope to see you Saturday for a thrilling adventure!

364,Friday Freebie - Kynikk the Debauched,3,j86n6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonsAndDragons/comments/j86n6q/friday_freebie_kynikk_the_debauched/,0,1602304009.0,"It's time to show some art progressions from one of our books, called [Masters and Minions](https://jetpack7.com/product/masters-and-minions-a-5th-edition-supplement-1st-printing/?attribute_pa_book-variations=pdf-only)!

We started with 2 sketches. You may recognize the one sketch we decided to move forward with. The color rough starts to show how the colors would be shown. When we received the final colors, I was concerned that the style did not compare to the rest of the pieces in Masters and Minions, so we worked on getting that fixed. The result was the final piece that you see in the book. While the original final is cool on its own, I think we ended up with an illustration the conveys a more intense scene...more *""metal""* and less *""Disney""*, if that makes sense.

Enjoy the images and a little bit of Kynikk's lore in between! You can download a sample of our works at the end of this post.

[Here's the first of the two sketches. We did not choose this pose.](https://preview.redd.it/fgp7ukron4s51.jpg?width=3400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff6e9ffd5e89b0fcad890629fc3ed58684f0953c)

*Kynikk the Debauched is not subtle. He is not bound by laws that stop him from harming the mortal world. He brings pain and misery with him into the human world, twisting it into his own playground. His fiends, the Vorakh, serve him in their own malevolent way. So long as they bring horror to others, Kynikk cares nothing for what they do.*

&#x200B;

[Now we're cooking with fire! Onward to the rough colors!](https://preview.redd.it/4lbxoezrn4s51.jpg?width=3400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2be08c3a0b491f6db32b6fb0aac6fcb6827d8805)

*Kynikk's ultimate goal is to turn the world into a horrid wasteland, one corner at a time.*

&#x200B;

[Not bad, not bad. Let's see what the final gives us...](https://preview.redd.it/t8j6do1tn4s51.jpg?width=3400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1f027f9d1da398d65771587d41cfe4eb29cbaf6a)

*The pathway between the Heavens and the Abyss is scorched with blood and the dead dreams of infants and madmen. Only the truly vile know the way safely. The rest must navigate a tunnel of uncertainty that leads into a boiling nest of hate and chaos.*

&#x200B;

[So, we weren't quite happy with this version of the final. It's looking a little soft and friendly... but we have some fixes for that!](https://preview.redd.it/ygarkumun4s51.jpg?width=3400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b7d63a3066bfb4213bfda0ff5965cab3dd379811)

I'm RPing him as magician*esque(not wizard). 
 And the first thing I came up with was Inquisitive Rouge but I have two player problems.

1. I don't want that to cause back lash for my Cleric and to be called out for heresy. Not the biggest problem, but would rather *avoid*. lol

Now there were allot of things that was wrong with their campaigns, but one thing always bothered me. 

So the setting was out of the abyss, and i had a concept of a dying silver dragonborn wizard who only had a few years left to live. His goal was to not die, he was cursed by a demonic cult and needed to restore his vitality.

It was a not a multiclass or any special thing, just basic rules. Sense we were in the underdark and my dragonborn looked very sickly and skinny, i asked if I could use find familiar for the octopus familiar. 

I asked if my wizard robes could cover most of my body and if i could put the octopus familiar with similar coloration to the grey looking scales on the characters face. That way he could have darkvision and see in the dark plus he would look like an mind flayer, so that most things wont bother him while he is down there.

Now the DM agreed to it, i also did tell him that it would take a bit of time for my character to reveal himself to not be an illithid to the party. I knew the party didn't really care if i was a mind flayer because i asked them and everyone said that it was cool and didnt conflict with any one else's backstory. 

So fast forward to session 1 from my side, the game went a little slow and wasn't that impressive, mainly due to the DM following the book like the law and never veering off the beaten path that the book showed had. 

So we get close to the end of the session and my character had been using disguise self through out the day in order to not draw any attention to himself because he looked like an illithid (forgot to mention we were in a durrugar city at the time), so we get to an inn and the party saw cought me using disguise self during the day so i ask them into my room. 

There i drop the spell and show them the real form (now i did i ask the DM if i could keep my dragonborn self a secret for some time due to backstory reasons, which he agreed to).  So while i was talking to the group about me being an mind flayer and telling them that i was on their side, the DM asked the entire party to roll a nature check.

Due to some people being druids and having really high rolls, the DM reveals that the octopus on my face was not my part of my body. At that point the party started pressuring me into showing them who i really am to a degree where my character felt threatened. 

After a bit I took of the octopus off my face and revealed my sickly form, now i was a bit annoyed and did ask why he did it but i was never given an answer. I no longer play with that group due to some other major issues, but i always wondered if i was wrong in that situation. 

Was the DM right in doing what he did? Am I missing something? Looking forward to what people have to say.",dnd

For example you could be a intelligence based cleric instead of wisdom based. Now that being said I’ve always tried to play a wisdom based warlock. I like the idea of a warlock who manages to create a pact with a devil by either being so acutely aware of a great powers presence within him that he finds away to enter a pact to manifest that power in exchange for his soul. Rather than his pact being the important part of his arc it is the manifestation of the sliver of power that he has been granted.

I digress. Every time I bring this idea up I get shot down because “no one would want that in their campaign” or “that is simply too overpowered” to which I respond “it’s not any more overpowered than a warlock already is” and “I’m loosing my ability to influence other players to become more aware of my environment” I could see an argument being made about the warlock spell list being catered to charisma, but I plan on playing a great old one hexblade and intend to limit my spell usage to those only suitable to how I view my power working. What do you all think? 

Am I wrong here? Is a Wislock too OP?",dnd

He started the campaign with his only real backstory being that he is the heir to a throne. He got involved with a group of adventurers that came to tell his father that the demon Tharizdun has been released

A quest to kill this demon results in the party coming face to face with the demon lords (one of which turns out to be his dad this entire time) and my character dying after he watched the entire party die in front of his eyes. 

He woke up naked in hell. Turns out one of our party members was a warlock of asmodeus and promised that if we reach the 9th later of hell he would send up back to the prime material plane

After helping zariel redeem herself she sends us to the prime material herself so f@ck the other 8 layers asmodeus

We return after a month in hell to find the world has fast forwarded by 2 years and on the surface everything seems fine (apart from the old capital being a storm land filled with bandits) but after a bit of digging it isn’t fine underneath, he has reason to believe that the world is actually being run by demons now, the paladin order is demanding ridiculously harsh  taxes and the leader of the order executed us. Then we know of someone leasing people to be eaten by baphomet.

After leaving he’ll my character started turning towards deity. He’s attending church and the party has just had an argument over whether they should try to kill baphomet which resulted in all of them telling him we can’t because we aren’t powerful enough yet to which his response was well why are we here in the first place then, we came back to kill Therizdun, if we aren’t fighting demons what are we doing

The result of this is he wished for the aid of a deity, I want to multi class into something that gets powers of deities, but I’m already 9 level rogue 5 level ranger so I only have 6 levels to work with

My character is pissed with demons and wants a God to help him, what class should I go for, I’m already level 14

well it started with us waking up to no animals around our camp and my friends telling me i needed to run as they suspected a dragon was coming so i get on my guard drake ( i am 4 feet tall a guard drake to me is a fucking horse ) and start to ride saying if it was not a dragon i wold go back for the egg later   


sure enough .... it was the mama dragon my friends saying we cant out run it i say behind and try to make some sort of peace with it by lying my way into makeing it think that i got it from people trying to make the eggs into wonderful food so i took it from them   


after some rolls she let me go and well .... i had to kill my friends for my freedom so we get to a nice enough city but i had to go by myself to plan on how to kill my friends   


i settled on poison as there was no chance i could kill a 9ft dragonborn paladin, a monk and a Cleric as a small 4 foot Kitsune bard   


so I look for a stretchy shop and buy a small some of green dragon poison for 200G and then a bottle of whisky for 10G leaginf me with 10G  and i go back and put 1 drop in each of my friend's whisky and then let it take its coarse   


unfortunately the monk did not drink and while i was with him the cleric heal himself and the dragonborn  ( i was not expecting a claric to be able to heal FUCKING DRAGON POISON at lv 4 but ok still new to this ) and shouted that the drinks are poison meaning the man i was with heard it so i had to try and kill him the hard way i try to pull him in for a grab and stab but we end up tumbling down the stairs and infront of the dragonborn, cleric, and guard NPCs telling me to explain my actions and so i told them that the dragon told me to kill them for my life and she gave me a bell to call her with when i am done for a ""prize""  


the guard takes the bell proclaiming that we was going on a black dragon hunt soon and then that is when the game was cut till next time   


now at first i thought that the dragon came cause i mentioned we did not know where mama is but i was told by a friend that the GM was planing to do this anyway which kinda pissed me off as i did want a baby black dragon but hay whatever

We quickly fought off the intruding ogres and as people began to gather around our party and our warlock (Kyle) thrusts the sword into the air and proclaims himself the swords rightful heir and king of the halflands (where humans and half-breeds live) our dm tells him to roll persuasion, insert nat 20. Crowd goes wild begins assaulting elven guards and we all siege the guard garrison. After fighting through a few floors of enemies we are all low health and enter a room with a lot of enemies. Our ranger decides to cast spike growth (which our dm and ranger flavored as vines sprouting from the ground/floor and covering the area) and then our warlock set it ablaze and I (fighter/wizard) decided to use my new whip that can extend up to 50ft and entangle people to drag enemies through the flaming spike pit. One shorting 80 knights. Our dm both hated and loved our creation.",dnd

Seriosly it seems like a goldmine, D&D is as popular as ever, there's clearly a market for it; people are so hungry for a fun dnd story they watch other people play it

Just come up with some fun character ideas, have every episode be about a new monster or something

there could be like a narrator that acts like a dungeon master, so the character get close to the mguffen and the narrators like ""Of course a true adventure is never easy"" he laughs a little and a blinkcat appears

They can make meta jokes, maybe a call back to the 80s cartoon like someone says ""are you an acrobat?"" ""An acrobat!? What kind of adventurer is just an 'acrobat!'? Im a monk!"" (Im not a writer, but you get the idea)

Get like ed helms to play a bard cause hes charming and can sing, have some fun guest stars like danny devito, felicia day, maybe an original voice actor from the first cartoon, have critical role characters show up, maybe drizzt

It will be released on November 17 on the DMs Guild, and we need help playtesting our content!

Featuring content like...

* Artificer: Effigist
* Barbarian: Cosmic Juggernaut
* Druid: Dragonfriend
* Fighter: Phoenix Knight
* Monk: Four Elements Remastered
* Ranger: Bog Phantom
* Warlock: The Creeping Vine
* Wizard: School of Demonology
* Races: anthropomorphic goats, survivors of magical catastrophes, rogue modrons...
* And much, much more!

Here’s how to become a QL Games playtester in 10 simple steps:

**Step 1.) Look at the schedule for our groups**

https://preview.redd.it/b3n9vzy1sxr51.png?width=1542&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe8ed7e0c82b14847edc517fe2a3ef17c1fe1f87

The schedule includes the Pacific (US), Eastern (US), Central Europe, and Japan/South Korea time zones. You can also find the schedule here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dBMdpbBHI9s3hHvu8\_EZtANA1u8nCwaLbu\_PcL809oM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dBMdpbBHI9s3hHvu8_EZtANA1u8nCwaLbu_PcL809oM/edit?usp=sharing)

There are 20 groups. Nine (in blue) will be running Blue Alley, and Adventurer’s League 3-4 hour adventure for 3rd level characters set in Waterdeep. Nine (in yellow) will be running Lord Bucket, an Adventurer’s League 3-4 hour adventure for 9th level characters set in Eberron. Two (in purple) will begin the last floor of Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage, for 18th level characters, and will stop after about 3-4 hours of play.

**Step 2.) Decide how many times you’d like to play.**

You can play in any number of the groups, subject to availability. In the application form (link below), you’ll be asked how many groups you’d like to play in (up to 3). You will be invited by email to anywhere between 1 and how-many-you-said-you’d-like-to-play-in groups.

**Step 3.) Decide which groups you have time and interest for.**

In the application form (link below) you’ll be asked which groups you’re interested in that fit into your schedule. When you’re invited to groups (step 2 determines the maximum amount of how many you can be invited to), you’ll only be invited to groups you mark.

https://preview.redd.it/dtynvt28sxr51.png?width=556&format=png&auto=webp&s=8df84ab823a4323e78ca0b09348da6176aa27e25

The second image lists the groups by adventure and platform. You can also see the list of the groups here (scroll to the right): [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dBMdpbBHI9s3hHvu8\_EZtANA1u8nCwaLbu\_PcL809oM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dBMdpbBHI9s3hHvu8_EZtANA1u8nCwaLbu_PcL809oM/edit?usp=sharing)

**Step 4.) Make sure you have a functioning email address and Discord account, and maybe also Roll20 account.**

You’ll be asked for your contact information in the application form (link below). If we can’t contact you, we can’t invite you to play! If you sign up for any of the Blue Alley (3rd level) adventures, you’ll need to have a Roll20 account too.

**Step 5.) Tell us what some of your favorite classes are to play.**

You’ll be given a pregenerated character to play as for each group you play in, and this will help us know what kind of character to give you. If you play in multiple groups, expect to play a different character each time. The pregenerated character will have a race and/or subclass from Tasha’s Crucible of Everything Else.

**Step 6.) Submit as soon as conveniently possible!**

Then submit the application! Applications are reviewed by hand, so it may take some time to get back to you. Please submit your application at least 48 hours before the start of the group(s) you want to play in, or else we might not be able to respond in time!

**Step 7.) Check your email**

You’ll get an email in the next few days after submitting your application, telling you what group(s) you’re invited to join. There will be a character sheet for a pregenerated character(s) attached to the email. The email will also have a link to the QL Games Playtesting Discord channel.

**Step 8.) Show up and have fun!**

When it comes time for your group to play, make sure you’re on the Discord channel! Group will start promptly, so if you’re very late you might miss some important parts or even be asked to not play in that group.

**Step 9.) Fill out a feedback survey**

After your group plays, you’ll be asked to fill out a survey about how you enjoyed your experience and what you think of the character you played. You’ll also be asked whether you want to receive an email in November with a 50% discount on the final Tasha’s Crucible of Everything Else product, and whether you want to stay informed on future QL Games playtesting opportunities and DND product announcements.

**Step 10.) Get a coupon!**

We’ll assume you said you’d like the discount. You’ll get a 50% discount for the final product as a special thank you for your input!

# FAQ

**Q: Is there a code of conduct?**

A: Yes there is! QL Games playtesters agree to the following code of conduct:

* I will not use words like ""gay,"" ""retarded,"" or ""Jew"" as derogatory slang terms.
* I will not swear excessively.
* I will accept bad rolls and inconvenient rulings with grace. If I cannot respond gracefully, I will remove myself until I may. (This is a great time to count down from 10)
* I will allow others to get attention from the Dungeon Master.
* I will pay attention and be ready to take my turn.
* I will not be a buttface.

**Q: Are there any groups playing in \[language\]?**

A: For this playtest opportunity, all playtest groups will be in English.

**Q: Will this be a tactical or theater of the mind style?**

A: Blue Alley one shots will use tactical play (using figurines and tokens on a Virtual Table Top called Roll20). Lord Bucket one shots will use theater of the mind (imagination). One Dungeon of the Mad Mage group will use tactical play, and the other will use theater of the mind.

**Q: The application form won’t work for me! What do I do?**

A: Some ad-block, VPN, or other programs keep the Qualtrics system from working. If you’re having technical difficulties, you can contact a QL Games representative at [QLGames@Yahoo.com](mailto:QLGames@Yahoo.com) to request a Microsoft Word file you can fill out instead.",dnd

He has sold his soul to a Devil, an Erinyes to be more precise and she has broken a promise outside of their contract, so he wishes to void his contract but the fate of his Wife and Kids are being held hostage of a mad woman whom plans to betray her own Master and try and take Malbolge from Glasya. 

In theory a good little mortal that I am I can stop this teachery from even happening by summoning Glasya and informing her of the betrayal of her Erinyes, but the complication is that the Erinyes has taken and hidden the souls of my Character's family in an unknown location that not even Vajra Safahr can identify the location of, nor the eyes of Corellon can see. This complicates things as my Character's lives are the only justification for his exsistance and having them being held as a carrot on a stick infuriates him. 

Currently the only three faintest ideas I have for their release are to complete the Erinyes' task in finding a crystal that has unknown power and hope she doesn't try this again.
Or the second idea is to contact Glasya, form a contract with the Archdevil in exchanging the Crystal and aiding the Princess of the Nine Hells in enacting justice upon the traitor for the freedom of his family and his own soul.
The third is going full balls to the wall, level up to nearly the highest level me and my party can reach as the DM stated she would have powers of that near an Archdevil, and locate their souls, kill the Erinyes in the Nine Hells and violating my contract and forfeiting his soul for their own well being creating a future character to play in the future to release their doomed father's soul from eternal damnation.

Any other ideas will be gratefully appreciated.",dnd

So in the game I’m a human Eldridge knight named Orion. Early on In our campaign picked this rectangular cube off a dead bugbear. On it in dwarfish was the word “key” and it has all these cogs on the out side of it. I’m a moron and I think that this thing is a giant key and someone tells me it has something to do with some mines to the north so I think I’ll go there and put this key into some big dwarf mechanism or something. Around this time 2 people ghost our new party leaving me, my wife, and a guy we met on here from canada who is now someone I consider a friend! And our dm. So we start seeing this person running long the roof tops and through perception checks we keep seeing them. We then get in a really hard fight in a town bunch of guys we pissed off totally not our fault I swear. Anyways well we all roll for initiative and then someone in the shadows does too and I think oh great I’m going die even harder. But this person helps us shooting some of guys and eventually joining in completely and taking damage to help fight the guys off. Turns out she is the person we have been tracking. She’s a dark elf named rezza played by our dm she joins our party and sense she doesn’t need as much sleep me and her end up doubling up on watches. And the dm and I role played talking. And over the sessions rezza and Orion became good friends and turns out I’m a moron and rezza was able to tell me that this cub was a box and the cogs could be moved around like a puzzle to open it and she and I start working on it together doing intelligence checks everyday on it and slowly opening it up. Well tonight her and I sit down like normal to work on the box and I hand the box over like normal and she tells me “go to bed” and I have to roll a wisdom saving roll. (Dice roll) 2. Epic. Fail. 6 seconds pass and I snap to run to the door after her. Roll for perception. 13. I don’t see her at all. I ask around the town the next day she’s gone no one has seen her. I know where she had to go with the box so I’m going after her we were suppose to do it together and I’m going to let her explain herself when I find her but if she just ripped me off just cause she could then we shall come to blows.

For the background of it I'm thinking that my character would have been a newbie Paladin of a temple who was sent out of town for a spell to handle a minor incident. When he returned the town was burned and pillaged, townsfolk and his fellows dead, his temple defiled.

He wasn't the only one angry and maddened by this. His god was not happy. It wanted blood for blood. So, it offered its last Paladin a choice, a chance to earn more power. A pact to use the embodiment of the god's anger to act out vengence at the risk of his mind.

He accepts.

He is playing a level 5 Bladesinger Wizard and wants to make a magic item to replicate the Sorcerer's Metamagic feature. I told him that he cannot make magic items that replicate a core class feature like Divine Smites, Metamagic, Action Surge, Channel Divinity ect. And he tells me that I'm thinking 2 dimensionally for saying that and given the time and recourses he should be able to make any magic item (or spell) he pleases because that's how it works in the lore apparently.

The reason I say he shouldn't be able to replicate these core class features is because it completely depreciates the value of those classes if a wi,are can just make a magic item that does all of their features ontop of their standard wizard progression and there would be no reasonable end if I let him do that. For example if I let him replicate Divine Smites with a magic item, why not let him replicate Bardic Inspiration or Warlock Invocations ect.

He says that he should because similar effects to class features can be replicated through things like potions, such as healing potions and damage potions (even though I've told him multiple times that healing and damage are not class features, they are gameplay mechanics that classes can utilize,) so if two classes can use the same sword or same spell he should be able to use metamagic with a magic item (even though he's a wizard with not a single level of sorcerer)

Concussion is a potent drug destiled from poisonous plants. 

Concussion has little ill effect, but it can temporarely erase memories, bloking the toughts someone have at the moment of ingestion. The creature will not remember those toughts/memories for the next 2d6 hours. 

Overdosing- If the creature take multiple doses of concussion while the effect is still active, the creature has to make an inteligence save or permanently lose the memories and toughts the drug erased.

If a caster that take this drug, he loses one of his prepared or known spells for the duration of the effect.
If he loses the spell ""permanently"" he can still re prepare it or re learn it.  

Spies and criminals sometimes use this drug before capture, to forget secret information or the crimes commited. This alow them to deny these things even under a zone of truth spell. 

Guarana dust

This dust is made from a rare jungle fruit seed. 

Guarana dust if ingested will give the creature a immediate energy boost, focus and alertness. 
The creature make perception and investigation rolls at advantage. The creature can also ignore exaustion effects while under the drug effects. As soon as the effect of the drug ends all the exaustion levels stack up. This can be fatal if the effect of the drug ends before the creature takes a long rest after acumulating 6 levels of exaustion.

Mamona oil

This oil is made from a small rare bean. 

The ingestion of the oil alow a creature to refuel one of its habilities by one use, or 1d4 charges as apropriate.
A fighter would regain his action surge, a sorcerer or monk would regain 1d4 sorcery points or 1d4 ki points. 
The oild can also affect racial features, alowing a dragonborn or dragon to regain its breath attack fir example. 
The creature is poisoned (condition) for the next one hour after taking the oil.

Figured I'd flavor all the important items I give them to fit the setting, and normally to have the items have some sort of pro/con.

The idea is to give descriptions of how the Orc becomes more and more tired after making a few devastating attacks i.e. ""his features become slack, his shoulders slump, his breathing becomes labored"", that kind of stuff, not sure if the characters will pick up on it, since they're not the brightest overall, but one can hope.

Worth mentioning is that the party is currently level 6.

Any comments or feedback would be much appreciated.

In that order I present to you:

&#x200B;

**Bragnan's Heavy Thumb**

*Weapon (maul), uncommon*

A crudely shaped Maul of fearsome strength, covered in bloodied cloth. 

It might have looked Dwarven-forged at some point centuries past but years of constant abuse and poor maintenance have taken their toll on it. The name ""***Bragnan""*** is instilled in the mind of the wielder along with fleeting memories of a forge covered in blood.

The haft emits a deep and unsettling pulse. Using it bestows an astounding if brief burst of raw strength.

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. It allows for the following special attacks:

**Surging Smash**

Add 3d6 Bludgeoning Damage to your next attack. On successful hit the target must make a Constitution saving throw or be knocked prone. 

Gain one level of **Exhaustion** at the end of your turn.

**Reckless Smash**

A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell's effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

Gain one level of **Exhaustion** at the end of your turn.

He feels personally responsible for the death of his friends so he turned to substance abuse. Normaly when someone wants to not feel pain they will turn to alcohol but seeing as my character is the talker of the group. I don't want him to be drunk all the time. I can't imagine he would be very effective in persuasion when he cant speak correctly. I am instead imagining a drug that he would take that is similar to a calm emotions spell but instead of saves against charming or frightening it makes it so he cant feel sad.

The story within this combat is they're looking for a banshee who remembers her worst traumas from when she was alive. One of which is her father whom continously abuses her and her mother.

The father is always prioritizing to kill the mother while she's alive during the combat.

When the mother acts she only skips her turn cleaning/cooking/crying. Whatever her abusive husband tells her to do. Once she's been killed the banshee (wich btw is not hostile during this combat) will revive her by using a ghostly med-kit. When she's revived she will kill herself with a sharp object on her next turn.

This combat also has 4 blink dogs cause her father liked hunting, so those are their hunting dongs representation in death. Which have advantage on attack rolls as long as there's 2 or more of them.

Once the bloated father dies combat fase 2 begins, which is way easier than fase 1, but i'm still doing some balance so I don't TPK.

If you read all the way down here let me know what you think of this 1st fase. Also I want to apologize if I made any ENG mistakes. It's not my main language

The Blood Line are a group of monster hunters based around a single family, the Dextiks (I was inspired by the Belmonts and the Witchers). They are 7th level or higher materiel. You can make your own members, as different campaigns take place at different times. There will always be 4 members, The Patriarch, The Matriarch, The Heir, and The New-Blood. The Patriarch and Matriarch are the leaders of the Blood Line until they pass. The Heir is originally from the Dextiks, but the New-Blood is married into the family. Every Dextik wears a magic item. The item is a ring, with a spell in it, finger of death. There are also guards that work for the Dextiks, they are still considered to be apart of the Blood Line. The Blood Line are rich, and own a manor in Darkreach (or your own town/city). Since each member is different, you can customize each member.

I’m trying to decide what to do with my point. I’m thinking either 1 in each of those 2 stats (from there with my celerity mutagen I can hit a +5) or a feat.  The feats are narrowed down to EA/CBE/SS (in that order). 

I would take the +1 from EA and drop it into Int to push that up to 16. I have the Curse or the Marked, so if I’m within 30 feet I can attack with advantage once for sure, but other than that I feel the “attack with advantage” would go largely unused, which brings me to CBE. 
I use a longbow primarily, so I’m mostly interested in the 5 feet thing, which I’ve confirmed with my DM as well but the bonus attack would be awesome (if I’m not burning through my health rerolling my rite again)
SS is a future goal I’m thinking. The -5 to hit is a little too high risk at my current level, so I’m thinking 12 at the earliest for that, though after a multiclass seems a little more viable. 


Like I said I’m thinking EA first. It’s because it’ll bring my int up to 16 as it’s going to start snowballing my damage before I can try again at 8. 

Anyway like I said, pretty new but those are my current thoughts and I’m wondering if anyone can help me narrow it down.",dnd

I started out with the ones that I think are counter-intuitive or fiddly, like Warlocks and Wizards, then moved on to the classes that I think are easier for beginners to pick up, like Clerics and Bards. Now, I'm covering another class that I think is great for beginner spellcasters: druids.

Druids are a great example of a class that is easy to pick up and fun to play. They can change their spell list every day, they're arguably the second most powerful healing class after Clerics, and unlike, say, Wizards, they don't have a ton of extra rules to learn as they increase in level. Add to that, early on, they get one of the most flavorful and powerful abilities of any class: Wild Shape. The ability to turn into an animal at will is not only fun; it makes Druids a lot more durable. That, in turn, makes them a lot more forgiving for beginners than Wizards or Sorcerers who pass out if you sneeze on them.

To encourage more newcomers to play Druids, I've put together another of my one-page guides for you to use at your table. I've included a downloadable PDF link at the end of the article so that you can hand out this guide to your players if desired.

I'm looking for staff for a new and progressively made Yu-Gi-Oh! Role-Play server on Discord. Yu-Gi-Oh! Thanatos. To be more frank, it's Yu-Gi-Oh! mixed with D&D. At the moment, the server isn't fully open for Role-Players, but I'm doing a staff recruiting, and training as well for the server so you can learn everything and get a grasp of the structure of how we're going to be doing things.

This roleplay consists of a fusion between dueling and battling in a fantasy setting, complete with dice rolls, combat procedures, and varied races. Immerse yourself in a rich lore built upon magic and an unbreakable code, backlit by death battles known as the Thanatos.

The people we're looking for should have a flexible schedule, experience is preferred but not required, knowledge about the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading card game and/or generalization of D&D is required as well as being good at the card game, knowing how to NPC characters, and follow general rules. If it isn't obvious having Discord is required. We're not in a rush for this specific position to be filled, but we'd really appreciate a writer. The reason we need a writer is for someone to help us with better grammar, and structuring of how things need to be written. I'm a good writer and all, but sometimes things around the server can use some tidying up. If you're pretty global that'd be nice as well, as we're looking people who can be on around at times when I the Owner, or my Co-Owner can't be around or is busy. Pretty sure the needing of trust is self explanatory as I don't need someone tearing my hardwork down. That wouldn't be good now would it?

Ive build quite a large scale series of buildings, and I want to make sure that it doesn't get boring. The bbeg has a few seperate groups following him, so I was thinking of having them each occupy a building, with a different theme and a reward for worth going and exploring. 

So first set of buildings will have a mix bag of people, as like a first build up and some exposition about the fortress

The second large building as a staging ground with a few tough guys,

The third as a barracks for cultists, so dark themes, some ritual stuff, and maybe like a curse puzzle type deal?

The next as a barracks for the hunters, a group of bad paladins, with perhaps just some more mechanical traps and stuff?

And the 5th as more of a store/treasure room before the actual main boss fight, so a chance to replenish some potions and gear and bits and pieces

My party and I are in Highport (Greyhawk) after having been captured by slave traders and escaped.

In a city of people we can't trust, how exactly do we find information? I tried last session to ask a priest of an evil God (as there are no good ones in this city) for some info (scroll of comprehend languages to read a book we found in orc, none of us speak orc, whole city is orc or half orc), and he wanted me to sacrifice someone in exchange. My character is CN, and DM explained that this would be an evil act, so alignment change.

Often they would make deals with her or run some errands (by some milk, put the cat out, steal Death's scythe, that kind of thing).  However, they weren't always smart with how they dealt with her. So, without further ado, here is a list of things, taken from my last campaign, that you should not do/say to an arch demon:

* Shoot them in the head
* When you've seen your friend slammed into the ceiling telekinetically while being slowly choked, don't use guiding bolt on the demon
* When confronted by the demon for guiding bolting them, say you've been raping their daughter (another member of the party. And they hadn't actually)
* When asked by your demon mother, whether or not she should TPK, say 'Go for it'
* For your master plan to kill the demon, drop an anvil on their head
* Wh... actually, this one needs context. So, in my world, gods are allowed to visit the world, but aren't allowed to do things directly unless provoked (for example, being shot). They are, however, allowed to get mortal agents to do things. So at this point Lilith was leading her own cult, and had sent two agents to bomb the square. The party killed one and tied up one. This is how the conversation goes (at this point, they hadn't met Lilith, and didn't know she was a demon or a goddess)

Cleric: Why did you try to bomb the square?

Cultist: Lilith ordered me to

No, that doesn't sound like something Lilith would do

Wha...

In fact, there's something you should know. Lilith has a mental illness...

I kn...

And it has split her personality in two. Her normal kind, loving self...

Say wh...

And this evil person she has become. It has split the cult into two- the side of the good, kind-hearted souls and evil. Tell us where Lilith is and we can cure her!

The fighter shoots the cultist and slaps the cleric

* Call them a stinky poo
* Sell your soul to them for cash
* Play awful music in front of them (this was from our half-orc barbarian who wanted to be a bard)
* When the demon has broken almost all the bones in your body and you're on one hit point, and will need magic to fully recover, have a 'friend' who slaps you, putting them on death saves
* Fail your death saves
* Try to seduce them (this was not only stupid, it was uncomfortable for Lilith's daughter)
* Declare your intent to get revenge to their face
* Help their twin sister and sworn enemy. Or at least don't get caught

That's just some of the many examples I have. This wasn't meant to be serious, just funny

604,My first real DnD experience!,6,j5dt0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonsAndDragons/comments/j5dt0k/my_first_real_dnd_experience/,0,1601904135.0,"I'll start off by saying I have played a couple sessions of DnD before in my life (25m) but would say I have had only a surface level understanding of the game. My previous experience was rolling a level 5 Ranger in 3.5 edition. So....yeah. Didn't really have an amazing time and was having a hard time getting immersed in such a complex and bogged down experience. 

Fast forward to this last week. I posted in a local Facebook group for DnD that I was a new player looking for an online group, meeting any evening of the week. I ended up getting really lucky and a super talented, dedicated, friendly fellow reached out to me and said he wanted to DM a new 5e game and we all agreed on Tuesdays! 

Fast forward to tonight. We are in our first actual session of our new campaign, level 2 characters in a Homebrew 5e story. I'm a Dragonborn Fighter. A real badass. My character agrees to meet with a female Dragonborn in order to gather some information, she is from a powerful family in our starting country. She promises help in exchange for my services. It's important to note here that my purpose for seeking her out was to discoverer why my character is cursed with not being able to use my fire breath ability. As a Gold Dragonborn I get fire breath but inexplicably cannot use it and never have..

Back to the meeting with the powerful Dragonborn woman. She offers us drinks and poisons us. It's just myself and my Bard. He fails Con save and gets paralyzed, I get poisoned. I stand up and draw my sword, feeling nauseous, as guards pour into the dining hall and surround us. The woman explains that she needs my power to perform some ritual, and will leave my Bard unharmed if I agree to be a sacrifice to Tiamat. I consider the idea that if I choose to fight here, I may actually die here in the first session. I decide to talk and buy time, while my Bard tries to recover from the poison. 

I slash at the first guard with my greatsword, cutting him down. After the guards have their turn of attacking me, I get to half health. I feel this rush of warmth like I'm going to vomit. Suddenly, I turn to the two closest guards and spit roaring black fire all over them, and they crumple in agony, screaming. I advance on the next guard, cutting him down as well. Just in time for my bard to wiggle free from his paralysis and we of course, ran out of there at full speed. I did steal a large mysterious sword on the way out. 

Anyway, I had the most fun I've had all year basically. It was so cool how organically the action unfolded and how my extra character story mixed with a little homebrew made for such an epic encounter. For the curious, I have a curse that gives me Necrotic damage to my fire breath and Necrotic Resistance instead of Fire.

After rolling some dice and cracking a few jokes with my crew it has been decided that my Cleric spends her time writing hundreds of love letters to her deity The Traveler holding them close to her person in hopes to find a way to send them. Even though she is told that the love from a God is not possible Belna still hold onto her feelings for him. 

My question is why would a mere halfing fall in love with her deity whom she also surves? How did she fall in love with him? Has she met him? Did he save her from a horrible death?

Another thing to mention is that Belna also has a son, though the current where abouts are unclear she has been betrayed by him and is left emotionally scarred (currently unknown as to how or why) and thus refuses to reveal her past to her party (because I have yet to make a complete backstory).

So how would you write Belna's backstory? What kind of life did Belna have when she lost her son, then falls in love with a deity whom she cannot have? Does her portrayed love to her Deity really be for her son whom she misses? And what of the father, did he pass long ago leaving mother and son divided?

One of my friends -who has never been near D&D or roleplaying games in general- came to me (he knows I run a game with a different group of mates) and said he wanted to get into D&D and asked me what he should start with. 

I myself started off with the Starter Set and haven't given the Essentials Kit a go. 

I don't think dice or screens matter so it's purely a question of length of rules (I know... but the more reading there is, the less likely he is to delve into our world) and ""quality"" of the adventure. They thought about getting into D&D after watching Stranger Things (...) and I don't know him and his group to be super into high fantasy stuff... I hoped you could help me be wise and all-knowing in their eyes! 

Thanks !!

In your opinion would a Warforged Druid wild shape into “warforged-like” animals? 

I know druids take on the shape of a normal animal regardless of race, but in my head I can see a Warforged turning into metal plate and ropey muscle looking animals and it looks great and flavorful.

That’s when the other question popped into my head, what happens to an usually ungendered race shifts into an animal with distinct genders? I guess they pick one. Kind of the same if a gendered Druid wild shapes into an organism with both sets of reproductive organs (like a giant earthworm).

One of the jokes made early on which has been used now some two years along. I'll miss dearly. So I figured I share it with you all, and want to hear yours as well

So fairly early on, our group was(still is really) absent a spell caster archetype. So early Arcane checks and magic checks where rough. However, myself a Cleric and our Druid. Did our best. But as you can imagine it never really went all that well, save a few lucky rolls.

One session, our group finds itself faced with a room of portals. Our worst nightmare. Myself and the Druid step forward as our beleaguered group looks on. Like two absent minded idiots staring at a smoking car engine attempting to appear as if they know what is wrong. We examine the portals. He rolls a 9, I roll a 2. Fan-tas-tic. The GM laughs a little. We turn back to the group in RP.

Rouge: ""Well?""

Druid: -embarrassed silence-

Cleric(me) having rolled a 2: ""They appear to run on some sort of magic.""

Follwed by pants wetting laughter from everyone. It's now the stand by response for any low or failed roll of any kind. ""It appears to be made of nature!"", ""It appears to be not of this world!""

I can't find a suitable sheet, here's a very basic example of the kind of thing I mean:

Either as a digital made story or as a ""printing out scenery from the internet""? 
I thought about the option of putting up a screen and connecting it to an iPad with some photoshop-ish software to create the scenes as we go. I understand that would be hard, and maybe not even doable.

Here are a few premade NPCs that are ready to go next time your players decide they want to talk to a random person or explore a random place. If you need some inspiration, these characters are yours to use. They come with a base stat block, a setting you will most likely find them in, an appearance description, a history, a shop (if applicable), and a small side quest that your players can do, if they have the time.

Round 2! This week, by request I have three NPCs that you might run into in a swampland village setting. As always, feel free to use as much or as little of these characters as you want. My only request is if you do art for them, please post it on this subreddit so I can see! I’m trying out a character who has an “interaction” instead of a shop aspect to him, let me know what y’all think. 

Irthros
Lizardfolk shopkeep
STR 12    DEX 10    CON 16    INT 8        WIS 11    CHA 7

SETTING: Irthos’ shop can be found in a swampy region, and travels from village to village selling his furs. 

APPEARANCE: Long before you approach his stall, you see his majestic golden frill atop his scaly head. He has a small tuft of a beard adorning his yellow eyes. He wears very little actual clothes, only wearing a loincloth out of modesty. Do not confuse his lack of clothing as a nakedness, though. He covers his top half with different armors, weapon carriers and shields. He has a small armguard on his left shoulder, which covers a raw spot that has no scales. If you trade him something, he might even show it to you. 

HISTORY: Irthos was born to a tribe of craftsman lizardfolk. Their way of thought was, if their weapon is good enough, even an idiot can survive. Taking this to heart, Irthos started to train to be a blacksmith, forging weapons that could be used for hunting. One day, while gathering materials in a nearby mine, he witnessed a gnome being attacked by a horde of vegepygmies. The gnome picked up a stone, and was able to tie it to a stick and beat the chief down, causing the rest of the horde to flee. The crude craftsmenship bothered him, but he also saw the power of improbable weapons. He started to experiment with slings and other weapons that can use the environment around you to your advantage. He now travels the swamplands searching for new and exciting ways to wield the world as your weapon. After all, what better weapon than the world the enemy is sitting on?

SHOP: Weaponsmith for trade
Irthos does not care for gold or money. He prefers the art of the barter. What good is a bag of gold when you are caught in the stomach of a Froghemoth? Much better to have a weapon to slay the beast. As such, he can forge any nonmagical weapon for you, provided you give him the material components and a little something extra. He prefers to have interesting and unique styles of weapons (ie a dagger with a heart shaped into it’s blade or a mace with porcupine quills instead of metal spikes) and will happily work on better weapons for you. DM’s discretion on which weapons are available and what components they require

SIDE QUEST: Space Sword
    “A week ago, a star fell from the sky somewhere in the swamp. I have not been able to locate it. If you find it, and mine it, I will make you a weapon from the star.” Find the meteorite that crashed in the swamp, and return it to Irthos to get a weapon forged from it. The weapon should have a minor magical trait about it. See small list bellow:
D12
1   Glows red with certain enemies are near
2   Deals additional 1d6 fire damage
3   Cannot get dirtied, will never dull
4   Has Thrown trait
5   Changes color with mood
6   Makes strange sounds as it is swung, confusing enemies
7   A ray of light shines down upon the wielder as it is unsheathed, this works even in caves
8   Silent, does not make a sound as it makes contact with an enemy
9   Must be attuned, when attuned, owner will always know location. 
10 Spreads glitter as it hits enemy, chance of blindness
11 Always grants advantage on attack, but has -3 to hit
12 Attunement: If owner HP would be lowered to 0 or less, instead it goes to 1, and weapon shatters. 



Thokk Sink (Concept by Echo)
Half Orc Glass Farmer HP 18
STR 10    DEX 14    CON 16    INT 8    WIS 10    CHA 14
SETTING: Thokk lives in the swamplands, but can be found traveling roads to the city from the swamp once a month to sell his wares. 
APPEARANCE: You’ll hear the jingling of his cart before you ever see him. As he rounds the bend, you might be startled by his overbearing appearance, sharp teeth, tall stature, and intimidating bone structure. The moment he opens his mouth and speaks with that warm, friendly voice of his, all of that tension immediately evaporates. 
HISTORY: The child of a noblewoman who fell in love with an orc chieftain, Thokk was a shameful secret of a small noble family out east. When he was 4 years old, his grandfather decided to take matters into his own hands. Late one night, he stole Thokk from his bed, and whisked him away. He took the child to a local wizard, and had him open a portal to a random place somewhere in the world, claiming he wanted to show his grandson the world. Once the portal was open, the evil man threw Thokk into it, and slit the wizard’s throat, closing the portal and losing Thokk somewhere in the world. Thokk found himself in a swampland, alone and lost. As he cried himself to sleep, he heard something approaching. The biggest snail he had ever seen moved right by him, leaving a shiny trail behind him. Terrified, Thokk sat there, silently weeping for fear of attracting the monster’s attention. He jumped into the tree when the halfling snuck up on him. His name was Jaron, and was a Flail Snail Farmer. He adopted the lost child on the spot, and trained him to be a farmer just like him. 
INTERACTION: Happy to help, this flail snail farmer is willing to help with anything the adventurers need. Inn too expensive? Come spend the night at the farm! Lost on the road? He’ll happily escort you to the next town! Need some rumors? He doesn’t have a bad thing to say about a soul, but will mention some interesting rumors about happenings around town. Need some help dealing with an angry shopkeep? Thokk installed most of the windows in the area. Maybe he can mediate a good deal.

SIDE QUEST: Old Bluer
“One of my oldest and favorite Flail Snails has been infected with something. Can you take a look and see if you can’t help him out? I’d hate to have to put him down.” Objective: Try to figure out what is wrong with the snail, and try to heal it if possible. NOTE: Flail Snails are resistant to magic, so Restoration spells will not work on them. Reward: Flail Snail Shell. “This old thing? I’ve had it in the shed ever since Old Redder died last year. Feel free to take it as a thanks for helping Old Bluer.” Flail Snail shells are worth a lot of GP or can be fashioned into anti-magic armor. See Volo’s Guide to Monsters for more details on this fascinating creature.



Flora Ambross
Human Level 3 druid, Level 7 Wizard
STR 7        DEX 9         CON 14    INT 17         WIS 16    CHA 10

SETTING: As you traverse any swampland, you may stumble upon a clearing. If you look closer, you might see a small little cottage, made out of blackened wood, with a chimney, always smoking. As you approach, you might find that the house has small little candies in a pot by the door. Feel free to help yourself to one, if you dare. 

APPEARANCE: Upon first look, Flora is a stout old lady, with a crooked nose, black hair, and a tinge of green on her skin. Her lips are as black as the night, and her teeth sharp like knives. She wears a black robe and a tall black hat. If she enjoys your company, she might take off the hat to dispel the glimmer around her. Her actual features are quite tame in comparison to the performance she puts on. Her nose straightens out, as her hair flows from black to red. Her skin turns pale, and her teeth turn straight. No matter what she looks like, her voice is calm, warm and welcoming… Unless you mistreat her. 

HISTORY: Flora was one of three sisters growing up. While her sisters were skilled in the magical arts of illusion and transmutation, Flora flourished with herbology and the healing arts. Her sisters, performing flashier and flashier magics, grew popular with the townsfolk and went off to live lives of extravagance. Flora, who was not so gifted with people skills, decided to isolate in the swamps, where she could grow her plants and just stay out of people’s way. Due to her isolation, she became known as The Witch of the Woodland. She decided to embrace these legends and asked her sister to create the glimmer hat that she now wears. Strangely enough, people started to seek her out, now that she was a slightly famous witch. After all, who better to go get a potion made than a witch? She started to capitalize on this venture, and will sometimes go to a local village to sell her wares.

SHOP: Potions
The Witch of the Woodland sells many potions, and can sell any potion in the PHB or DMG (or any other at DM’s discretion). However, make sure to note which ones came from her, as there is a 10% chance it might have an additional effect. 

Roll|Effect|Result
---|---|-
1|The potion causes gastric distress|Gain 1 level of exhaustion
2|The potion turns the drinker into an unnatural color for 1d12 hours|
3|The potion makes the drinker glow for 1d12 hours|Disadvantage on all stealth checks
4|The potion makes the drinker lose control of their mind for 1d4 hours|Has a craving for Cactus Juice. It’ll quench ya!
5|The potion gives the drinker hives!|Disadvantage on all skill checks until the itching stops in 1d6 hours! 
96|The potion tastes super spicy!|Drinker gains Dragon’s Breath fire damage (XGE 154) 
97|The potion tastes banefully bitter!|Drinker gains 1d6 temp HP for 1d12 hours 
98|The potion tastes sinfully sweet!|Drinker gains 1 use of the spell Charm Person 
99|The potion tastes strangely sour!|Drinker gains advantage on saving throws for the next 1d12 hours 
100|The potion tastes dreadfully dry!|Drinker gains double the base effect of the potion.

SIDE QUEST: Amber Alert
“My niece was supposed to come visit with some supplies from the big city. I got word that she was going to be here yesterday, but I have not seen her yet. Please go find my niece, and I can reward you well!” Objective: Find Fauna Nightingale. She most likely got distracted in the woods on her way over. She does tend to stop and pick the flowers. Reward: a potion of heroism

Given that one of the first books that caught my eye in the 3e era was the original Creature Collection, before the Monster Manual had even hit stores, I was a little nostalgic when I backed this.

the next time i was in i did nothing of value as i had nothing to deal damage to a dragon  


next time we had to go and destroy a cultist camp after there successful raid me being the smartest one decided to play off the fact they just did a raid and got away with some good loot and they wold be partying hard for the night to go in with the party and act like cultist  


i was the only one to not nearly give us away and spill alcohol all over the camp and 2 of us got found out cause they don't know how to act natal   


Que the party getting the other party members trying to get our other players out of jail with someone we needed to grab for a side quest  


then once they are out i light up all the alcohol i spilled due to my amazing sneak skills and then the place goes up in smoke due to a nat20 on fire check now nameing her Summer Pyro Cosby   


next game after we explored a cave and my character has built in dark vision so i am good as we then burn down a mushroom forest by mistake and later on we find a door that has 3 guard drakes in it my party is all pansys but i try to tame them with the dead bodies of cobolts we killed as food i roll a nat 20 a moded 24 and a moded 19 i got to keep 1 guard drake later on in the cave we find a Black Dragon egg

I'm 31, and I've always wanted to play DnD but only just started finding other people who are interested in it as well recently. I've been dipping my toes in, learning about the mechanics, and I just bought the Handbook 5th Edition/Monster Manual and such type beginner materials. 

To the point, my family and I don't get along because of politics, and they've agreed, out of the blue, to learn how to play this game as a family in an attempt to reconnect in a new way. 

What this means is that I have 30 days to learn how to DM a one sitting 2-3 hour campaign before we do our first family trial run of it at a cabin getaway weekend. 

If anyone would be willing to help me accomplish this task I would greatly appreciate it!

&#x200B;

TLDR: IRL Quest, help me learn to DM in 30 days to try to save my family relationships.

ADDITIONAL INFO

I've gotten a game mat, a few sets of dice, and character cards (they want to start just by picking premade characters before they venture into making their own). I also have the partition thingy. Anything else that would be worth investing in? Because even if this doesn't work out with my family I'm still going to be learning to DM for my friends, the family thing is what puts the 30 day time crunch on it is all.",dnd

I've had two D&D groups so far, but we never made it much past character creation and none of us \*really\* knew what we were doing. I would go to a card shop and start a beginners round or something, but it's the time of corona and I'm egregiously shy/full of self doubt. I'm afraid they'll think I'm an idiot since I wont' know how to play, i'll fumble over races or locations, etc. 

Sigh. Long story short. I want to start playing D&D on roll 20, and while I realize they have beginner groups, I want to be somewhat primed to the gameplay and lore. Do you guys have suggestions? Do I just pick up the 3 books and read them cover to cover? Do I just watch D&D lets players? Do I need to read books or lore guides? Should I find Roll 20 specific players and watch them play with the online interface? How can I ensure that I \*know\* what i'm doing at the start of my first game?",dnd

I hit on this kind of weird idea when I was writing out goblins for my own campaign (they're spiteful, dangerous cannibals with a high reproduction rate and no sense of community beyond strength).  I invented this cabalistic aspect of goblin society around hexers, spellcasters who focused entirely on cursing others for fun, spite, or profit (from removing said curses).  I want to play a goblin spellcaster who only casts curses.

Now, there's some great debuff spells that I can reflavor as curses like Hideous Laughter (Giggling Curse), and Sleep (Drowsy Curse).  But I'd like to come up with a way to go a little more all in and pull from different schools of magic without compromising my ability to help the party.  What would be the best set up to encompass this concept?  I'm thinking either an Enchantment or Divination wizard or a Book Warlock.

I also want to invent a few spells that act as lesser curses, including some sort of invert Prestidigitation which instead of cleaning clothing could dirty it up or cause a coughing fit or sneezing and the like.  But am I better off inventing spells that require the DM's approval or trying to reflavor existent spells as curses.

Finally, I'd like to be able to create curses that could function as traps.  I'm thinking some kind of feat called Hexing where a spell can be cast on a space or object and takes effect when the space is moved through or the object is picked up.  A spell which requires concentration still requires concentration while the trap is active, but the duration begins when the trap is triggered.  So I could cast heat metal on a sword, but it would only take effect when it was drawn, or cast command: trip on a tile in a narrow hallway that would target the first creature to walk through the tile.

&#x200B;

Are these concepts overpowered, underpowered, or reasonable?  I'm struggling with this character construction on a purely mechanical basis as I have his entire attitude and background and what not sorted.  I just want to make my nasty little goblin (or reskinned halfling/gnome if the DM doesn't allow goblins) who is constantly muttering curses and casting them for his own amusement or irritation.",dnd

Back in February, I challenged myself to come up with daily homebrew content related to a specific theme. I enjoyed it and asked my patrons for a theme for September, and one of them suggested Sept-umbra (a month of shadow/darkness content).

I have shared a few of the results here on Reddit so far, but since that month is done and lists are handy, I am listing the entire collection below. Links to the individual creations can also be found on my [Giant List of Homebrew](http://www.amethyst-dragon.com/Aenea/hb_.htm).

While the content is hosted on Patreon, nearly 1/4 of it is free for everyone to use (noted in the list).

Enjoy!

Part of that is every teacher has to run a club that last for approximately 45 minutes two days a week. Last year I had a bunch of students who would come in during lunch and advisory to play D&D. They were self-sufficient, so I figured they could easily run their own campaign and I could be there to supervise. So, this year I thought why not make that club to let my same small bunch of kids blow off some steam between classes.

Boy was I wrong. At signs up we had 35 kids and during our first meeting today we had upward of 50, with around half being 1-2s on a proficiency scale caping at 5.

I was apparently dreadfully wrong about how much I would need to provide and do for this club. I want to do it right done them, but I also just don’t have the time. We were told that clubs shouldn’t really be any additional planning, so I obviously didn’t plan for this massive swarm of middle schoolers wanting to play.

So, now that the background is out of the way, I am looking for recommendations, resources, advice, and anything else people are willing to provide to help me out on this journey. I really want to make the most of this club and give these students some social interaction and enjoyment.

Oh, the kicker? I recruited a second teacher who has zero D&D experience to do this with me. I told him it should be easy since it would mostly be student-run. I imagine he may hate me right now, but he has been awesome about watching videos and trying to immerse himself in all of this.",dnd

Any tips or suggestions on how I can make the game interesting I would be very happy to hear

I'm very new to DnD, we have just set up a new group and we are about 5/6 sessions in.

Our regular DM hasnt had the time to organise a new session due to work but I've had an interesting idea for a one shot campaign so I've offered to run a quick game this Sunday.

To give a bit of backstory our party had previous killed a mantacor and adopted/kidnapped its child, I became very attached to him and named him Manny.

We were clearing out a group of Orcs and in the mayhem Manny escaped.

In my game I am going to have our characters play a game of D&D in D&D, my character will be the DM and is going to mix up the character sheets so the characters will all be playing as each other.

The campaign will involve Manny getting kidnapped and the party rescuing him from an evil wizard who will later be revealed to have been our normal DM in disguise, he is going to do a monologue about how he kidnapped Manny to stop us having fun.

Please note I am not really pissed off at our DM but thought this would be really funny and meta.

TLDR - My first campaign is going to be a game of D&D in D&D and a sly dig at my usual DM for taking away my favourite pet",dnd

I'd like to hear people's thoughts and opinions on the subject. I've got two main ideas on my mind (but am open to other suggestions). I'm currently bouncing between a Feral Tiefling and a Warforged.

Tiefling:-Works better for backstory. I want them to be missing multiple limbs so they use their Power Armor as prosthetics. The armor also keeps them hidden as it covers their entire body. They're in a foreign land (Humblewood) and the people would likely murder them on the spot (because spooky demon human boi)

Warforged:-They don't need to worry about sleeping in their armor the same way a Tiefling would. However, They lose the whole ""gotta hide my appearance lest I most likely be murdered on the spot"" thing which was something I really wanted to RP.

Not sure what to do. I've talked with the DM and they've said sleeping in the armor would impose the normal issues, BUT they may consider allowing my character to ""keep parts of the armor on as prosthetics"". I have also considered playing as an Elf since they don't sleep. Best of both worlds, but... I mean... Elf...

Jokes aside, I'm curious what other people think on the subject.

The party was fighting a bone naga. For those unaware, bone nagas are nagas that had their flesh and their immortality stripped away by y-uanti rituals. The party encountered one of these undead searching for magical items in a lost temple that they had heard rumor of. One of my players is playing a LE pureblood seeking to restore his race to their previous glory, to this combat encounter was very fitting.

The combat comes to end with the naga fleeing for its life. It’s turn ends just in the range of the pureblood’s short bow. He rolls attack. A natural 20! Yay! The party wins. This is a great accomplishment for his character. Then, after dammage has been rolled, I remember that the bone naga had cast bestow curse on the pureblood. “Wait,” I say, “sorry, you need to roll with disadvantage becouse of the curse.” He rolls again. Six. The arrow veers off and is lost in the undergrowth. The snake slithers off, bones rattling against the forests floor.

I think I failed here. I robbed them of their victory. I didn’t just have him roll with disadvantage, I recalled what I had previously said becouse I remembered something that I had previously forgotten. But, I’m new to this. All of my players are. I made a mistake and If I find myself in this situation again, I’m going to let it go becouse the experience will be better.

Sorry for the long rant, but now I’m interested in reintroducing this bone naga as a minor antagonist. To beef up the encounter, I can use the options for the extra spells from the spirit naga variant but I’m interested in knowing what underlings a bone naga could have.

Why would they say with a master? Are they allies? Cultists? Friends? What would they have to gain? The setting is the small isle of Delismara in a more tropical Atlantic climate. Anything that could live in a fantasy forest is fair game. I already have an aboleth cult as a main antagonist so this should be a bit more understated. Thanks for the help!

I was looking for some advice on a character build. The dm suspects our adventure will go to 12th level and we are staring at 1st.
First the fluff. Joshua Smith is a human who’s been a farmer for over 25 years and all his life. Recently he’s decided to give the adventurers life a shot, because honestly ‘how hard can it be?’ Joshua, or Farmer Jo to his friends, took a shovel ,who’s spade had broken off, (quarterstaff) and a barrel lid (shield), packed his things and set out for adventure.

Farmer Jo is a variant human fighter. I had originally played with the idea if having his highest stat be wisdom and starting him with Magic Initiate to smack people real good with his whoopin stick. Then I started worrying he wouldn’t be as effective front line defender if I did focus Wisdom for that build. So now I find myself questioning either a pole arm str build or a shield dex build.
My goal is to be able to defend my squishy allies while also dealing out a lot of hurt to the baddies. We are using the point buy. I want to keep in mind that he is a simple farmer, he doesn’t have a formal education so Eldritch Knight is a no most likely. Other than that, I’m just lookin for ideas. Thanks for your help!",dnd

My intro to DnD was through Critical Role Season 2 (up tp Ep30), and I've since bought the player and DM's handbook. Other community members have pointed me towards some interesting beginner campaigns/missions to run, so I feel like I have a decent foundation to work from. 

What I'm thinking about now is how to flesh out the world with more colour, and be able to provide details to my players about the wider world they're in rather than just the tavern/cave/city that's right in front of them. So where would you look to draw on the Lore, History, Politics and Culture of the DnD world?

Now, I get that 'the history of the DnD world' isn't really a thing, and that the basic premise of DnD is that that it consists of thousands of overlapping multi-verses so to ask for 'a history' is kindof silly. But where would you go to get the broad strokes of a fairly standard DnD world, just so I don't have to create it all myself/think it up on the fly?

My understanding is that there are a few official books that cover this kindof thing i.e. 'Guildmasters guide to ravnica', 'Sword Coast Adventurers Guide' Wayfarers guide to Eberron' etc. Think it's worth picking up one (or more?) of these? Are these separate universes or more like continents of the same world? 

In particular, I saw there's an 'Explorer's guide to Wildemount' which fleshes out the backstory of the world that Critical Role Season 2 takes place in. Picking that up is kindof appealing just because I've already integrated a decent amount of that through watching the show, and so wouldn't need to learn it anew like I would for a different setting. Any drawbacks to this that you can think of?

And how about online resources? Coming from Warhammer I'm used to having the incredibly well put together Lexicanum wiki to check which century A invaded B, who invented C or when D started their breakaway empire. I scouted around for a similar resource for the DnD world but most seemed focused on class abilities and spells rather than the wider lore of the world. 

How might you go about building a rich and detailed history, politics and culture for your DnD world? How would you make that easier for yourself? And what resources would you use, free and paid-for?

Thanks everyone!",dnd

Things started out pretty well, the party was in Bryn Shander heading towards the inn when they were approached by a group of dwarves asking them to bring back a sled full of iron ingots. They decide to accept the mission and head towards the last known location of the missing sled. Well things go from good to bad in a span of a few minutes when they encounter six goblins pushing the sled towards a huge wagon pulled by two polar bears. Since my party was able to sneak up on the goblins they got to go first, they missed. None of the players even rolled high enough to hit the goblins so one of the players called out in Yeti to try and get reinforcements and suprisingly enough it worked.. Running down from one of the near by hills 3 small yeti run towards the group and thankfully the player was able to convince them to help. He has the littlest Yeti secert. After a few rounds of my players missing, stumbling, and pooping themselves in the middle of the fight by only rolling 1s and 4s all but one of the players gets knocked out so I had the small but strong Yeti try to save the group by throwing them onto the ingot filled sled and run away. Unfortunately my players failed their saving throws, one falling off the sled and freezing to death while they other was taken away by the yetis.... let's just say they woke up grogy from all the booze, drugs, etc they had taken once they arrived at the inn. They remember ignoring the dwarves and heading towards the warm inn instead, realizing it was all a horrible dream.. Fastest possible party wipe I have ever run.",dnd

We're not that bothered about experience over people who enjoy telling stories and preferably a flair for improv or at least rolling with the punches.

The Pouch however cannot hold anything that is bigger than it's opening (if say its as big as your pants pocket, you won't be able to pull something larger than your pocket out of it). But that 1 thing will be infinite. 

Could be dirt, could be water, could be fire, could be syrup, could be coins, etc. Note however that simply passing the pouch back & forth will not change what that 1 thing is for the person who previously owned it. 

So it has the possibility of being highly beneficial, most often times useless, but also incredibly dangerous cause what if you reach in and you pull out your hand drenched in acid? But another person pulls out a platinum coin? Or another pulls out poop? 

Try to answer this question without mentioning something that already exists (such as the Wand of Wanding), or if it does exist, then modify what it does, just with the requirement of being mostly useless but potentially dangerous.",dnd

It was a while ago, so I'm not sure what classes we all were but I think I was a first gen Blood Hunter (called Witch Hunter then).

We had been ambushed furing the night by a large pack of werewolves and had fled to the top of a nearby abandoned tower. We were surrounded and trapped, but the werewolves couldnt reach us. In the scuffle, one of my companions had been torn up by the beasts and we weren't sure if he was potentially infected with the curse.

I asked the DM if my character knew any cures for lycanthropy. He asked me for an Arcana check. Nat20.
He asked if I was proficient in Arcana, I was.

He then asked me, ""what is the cure for lycanthropy.""
I was taken aback. I was still relatively new to D&D and had no meta knowledge of Monsters. Everything was fresh and shiny and wonderful.

I turned to the (potentially) infected player and said, ""you must eat the stillbeating heart of the Werewolf that infected you, before the next dawn.""

Everyone got a ""holy shit"" face and got super excited. We had to pinpoint the correct werewolf that attacked him, kill it, cut out its heart, and have him eat it, all before sunrise.

We created a distraction, grabbed the one we thought was right, went back up the tower and finished the cure.

It was pretty fucked up, but I look back at that moment fondly. The DM had let me add something to the world and it felt cool. The other, more senior players had gotten excited over this task and we had a lot of fun fulfilling it.",dnd

I've already run little one-shots that have taken place in rough drafts of the world but it's definitely still a work in progress.  
So, I've been developing a world for a long time now, not for anything in particular, I just enjoy worldbuilding. Only recently have I thought that it would make a cool D&D campaign setting. I've already got a lot of lore and now I'm supplementing it with D&D monsters.   


The world is known as Nevaria. It's a world that has been shattered by a great war and split into various island continents, 5 major continents make up the world. Morah, the Isle of Mana.  Ciradella, the Capital of the Empire. Necroth, the Isle of Labyrinthian Rifts. Dorgama, Isle of Dragons. Lastly, Ilkratha, Isle of the Mists. Each of the islands has different adventures to go on and various foes to conquer.

The main adventure I have planned is for 4-6 players going from level 1 to level 20. The main quest would take the players across the five islands to collect five keys known as the Keys of the Chalice, which have been put into the possession of five dastardly villains with some fairly customized stats. Gretun, The Shapeshifting King of Trolls. Nazga, A Dark Necromancer.  Mogratha, The Queen of the Black Dragons. Karganthus, The Horned King. Lastly, Helgrin, Elder Sister of the Black Gospel.  These five work under the rule of a dark god, Naudric, God of the Black Gospel, The Profaned Lord.  This adventure would take players all across the five islands and would include the clashing of all sorts of factions, good, evil, and neutral. Many side quests would crop up along the way as well. All of the bosses would be homebrew (though some would be modifications of former stat blocks), and their minions would follow suit, also being homebrew (and some of them would be modifications of former stat blocks).

In the beginning...as in the first addition of the AD&D rules...paladins had to be lawful good. The character class was a sub of the fighter class, and one that was restrictive in many ways. 

I remember the first time I chose the paladin for my primary character. I felt it was a great way to hedge against not needing a cleric in a higher level party(one paladin plus numerous healing magics). More fighter power and offense should be able to convert to victories in the dungeon, right?

Not really. The DM held to the rules with great conviction, making sure that all of my decisions, all of the paladin's decisions, were lawful good, or be cast out and made into a normal fighter. So, while the rest of the party laughed at me, running amok in the dungeon and gaining wealth much faster than I could, I sat there trying to figure this class out.

In the end, there wasn't much to be done. There were restrictions that I didn't like. Maybe it was just me not being very lawful good in my real life. I dunno...perhaps....

There was one good outcome though. One person in our party had gone out and bought the newly printed Deities and Demigods book. Connecting the paladin to a god gave me new thoughts and actions that made dealing with the restrictions a bit easier. Bringing the ""Will of Gods"" into a campaign probably made the DM's job a bit more complicated, but for a player, I enjoyed the new dimension in the game. 

I never agreed with the mandate of being lawful good, however. A paladin was a champion of a cause, whether good, neutral, or evil. And what about the anti-paladin? I felt it was foolish. In the world of first addition AD&D it was the best they could do, but clearly it needed adjusting...and in the end, that is exactly what happened.

As of AD&D fourth edition, the paladin was freed to do other things. The paladin no longer needed to be lawful good, he simply needed to follow the tenets of his chosen deity. No more policing and nitpicking by our fellow players...oh, but that wasn't actually true.

In the fifth edition, the paladin could chose a specific cause or oath that would drive the paladin down a certain path of actions. Still restrictive, but it allowed me to create a paladin that would better suit my emotional state in the ""real world"". Still, I always felt a monkey on my back no matter which way I played this character. 

Is a paladin best suited to be a NPC? An agent of the DM designed to elicit a certain response from the party? I strayed from the path of the paladin and never looked back....until about a year ago.

I decided I would put every single thought I'd ever had about epic fantasy into a world of my own creation. In doing so, I created a central kingdom ruled by a king that wielded godly might. I created a world where gods interact with the world around them on a daily basis. This king worshipped the ultimate God of Balance, and because this king can't go around slashing and hacking, he needed a champion that could do it for him.

Enter the paladin...a champion to keep the Balance forever, and always. Apparently, I'd not forgotten about this class of fighter that had always intrigued and baffled me. 

My paladin, whose cause is the Balance, and who worships Vilagir, the God of Balance, would be able to do things that no paladin before him had been capable of doing. Not true neutral, and as a matter of fact, not even needing a set alignment...this warrior would satisfy the needs of his god as he saw fit and walk the planet of Sphaera being feared, loved, and above all...respected and hated at the same time.

That paladin is Belevus. He is a construct of mine that I can't wait to wrap many a story around for years to come.

And so...please, please tell me about your paladin. Tell me your understanding of a paladin and how you've done ""out of the box"" things with the character. Tell me your struggles with the class. Tell me about your causes and the gods your paladin worships. I want to know more...Thanks.

We have a bard in the group, who has spells like suggestion and zone of truth, so I don't want similar spells. My idea is to give her spells that are a mixture of battlefield control, destructive (ideally more lightning/thunder, due to being a tempest cleric) and utility. Also, being a conjurer, she gets to teleport at level 6, which recharges when casting conjuration spells, so a wide mix of those would be useful. She also has the Izzet Engineer background.


She currently has the following spells on scrolls: disguise self, identify, mage armour, magic missile, darkvision, hold person, invisibility, magic weapon.

Very new to D&D, only experience is critical role essentially, but my friends and I are starting a campaign - DM told us to prep some rough PC ideas for ourselves. 

I'd like to try half-elven, multi-class Rogue/Cleric. Background something along the lines of:

He's the son of an Elven mother and Human father - both nobles forced to wed and have a child as part of a treaty of some sort (specifics of that will need to be worked out with DM I guess). Growing up, although he lived extremely comfortably and surrounded by wealth, he was exposed to how corrupt and horrible the dealings of his family truly were. His parents had many other children in order to marry them off for other alliances and nefarious deeds. As one of the youngest, he was left relatively unnoticed by his family, which suited him just fine; he got quite used to it, and eventually, he got quite good at it. Growing sick of the corruption and cruelty, heartbroken by the actions of his family, he turns to faith. He wants to help the people his family has wronged, but he knows he can't do it in plain sight.

I want him to essentially be an assassin, but good. At his lowest, he's a Robin Hood type, at his best, he's assassinating corrupt aristocrats at dinner parties and working to replace them with true nobles, all of which is done with the guidance of his patron deity.

My big question is which deity suits that best? I thought maybe The Raven Queen, but that felt too much like I've just stolen Vax from Vox Machina. Also googled a bit and found Helm, but I'm not sure if he's too much of a tank and ""fight in the light"" type for that to work. Really need a stereotyoical, almost Assassin's Creed ""work in the dark to serve the light"" type. I'm happy to homebrew if my DM is, she's pretty open, but do y'all have any suggestions?",dnd

So I was looking for a new army to build. 

Immediately, I decided to expand the story of my custom planet, and to add on a new SM successor chapter, which is just getting back on its feet after being all but annihilated in their endeavor to save the planet. Now the planet owes them (which they're happy to repay the debt), and have been sending their best to the marines to bolster their ranks as best they can (of course, very few of these best and brightest of a planet survive to be inducted to the chapter). The problem is, this chapter still doesn't have many fully fledged battle brothers yet.   


That's the super short version of the story for the chapter, but when it comes to the actual \*game\* part of 40k, I know practically nothing about SM... so I was wondering if it would be viable to have a scout heavy SM force? Now, I'm sure that it'd be a non-competitive force, but I care more about narrative gameplay, so I'm not looking for an optimal SM army. I just want to know if it'd be ""not god-awful"" to do something like that (AKA, I don't want to have an SM force where most of the troops are just glorified guardsmen, if that's all scouts really are) If it is viable, what would you suggest to use to shore up the weaknesses of scouts? (I get super lost when trying to differentiate between intercessors, aggressors, eradicators, etc....Heck, it might be useful just to point out what a ""standard"" marine army is composed of for a 1000 point game of 40k.)",40k

(White Scars successor),1,jbzv6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/jbzv6i/iron_talons_chapter_question_white_scars_successor/,0,1602837610.0,After looking through the white successor list I found the Iron Talons who I like the colour scheme for as well as the fact they wear flayed skin on their armour. According to the lexicanum they are only mentioned in a word bearer novel called 'Dark Creed' where they apparently send 6 companies to support the white consuls. I don't really care much for chaos so I'm not going to buy the book but I was wondering if anyone had read it and recalls if there was any mention of how the Iron Talons fought or maybe if their captains are called khans? I like the colour scheme of the dark hunters but being a fluff painter I don't like the fact that they are more raven guard than bike riding maniacs like their parent chapter. If anyone recalls i would be grateful for the information.,40k

I had to constantly turn it back to a point with my palm.

So am I doing it wrong? am I applying too much force on the brush? because if I am, I was doing it because the paint isn't sticking to the model, so should I thin my paints more?

Let's just get straight to it, Im not a toy collector. I don't play 40k the table top game, or warhammer... Or any table top game.  I've never painted anything other than walls and a few paintings in elementary school.  I have no idea what I'm doing other than what I've seen in the numerous YouTube vids I've watched....but I love WH.

  I've played a bunch of the games (for better or for worse), I've read a few of the books, and I've got a pretty alright knowledge of the lore.   I can't tell you names of characters and dates they did things.... But I can yell ""purge the heretics"", and that's all thst counts, isn't it?

So with that out of the way, I saw one of the Mcfarlane WH40k primaris intercessor figures.... And I had to have it.

So now I have it, and it's awesome. Solid model, solid possibility, just a  solid huge chunk of plastic.  But man, is it ever clean.  Like this dude just went through a car wash and paid for extra detailing.   I want to do a black wash and some dry brushing to make him look a little more.... ""40k"".

How should I go about doing this?  Wash first then dry brush?  Dry brush then wash so it's not too bright in comparison? The figure is very matte, should I use a matte grey/silver so it doesn't stand out too much?

I plan on using some cheap acrylic paints and cheap brushes... This going to be ok?.. .. Look, this is going to (most likely) be a one time thing, so I'm not going to spend 10$+ on fancy GW paints.  Walmart crap will do, right?

Most of that was described previously, but the thing I'd like to highlight is that the January releases haven't been teased fully yet, but we did know it was Dark Angels on the Imperium side, and ""the next Xenos"" supplement after that.

Is it normal that almost all aspect warriors are either older then I am or overpriced like there was no tomorow?

Even the ones updated come in boxes of 5 while space marines, even newer ones look like better in every single way and come in 10/box?

Like, banshees look cool but are 40€ per 5 infantery sized models while intercessors are the same price for 10 models? What about dire avengers, they are barely any points worth and come also in packs of 5/32€?

Then we noticed that in some cases, because the objectives couldn't be placed within 6 inches from a table edge and 12 inches from each other, in some cases you couldn't acutay place all three down without careful consideration of the placement of the first two. I'm sure in some cases it's not even possible to place three nobmatter what you do.

I personally buy the Codices for the lore and since I remember every unit in the Codex has a page, or at least half a page for each unit with some nice Artwork of the unit. Now, I am a big Xenos fan and the idea of a brand new Necron codex filled me with joy and so I bought the limited edition version of the Codex for 60 €.

Today it finally arrived and, while the artwork is fantastic, I sadly noticed that there are actually no pages for the units. I double checked with my 8th Ed codex and it still had it, so this has to be something new. It pretty much only has the Datacards with a little blurb but no real unit lore, no special Artwork for the unit etc. Atleast most characters got it but I was quite baffled tbh. I know its quite redundant to have 2 different Unit sections, but I always loved the lore for each unit and the many amazing artworks dedicated to them. While the rest of the book is quite nice it feels a bit ""cheap"" to me to get rid of this section. Is anyone else also a bit disappointed with this?",40k

For such bases, how many magnets should I glue? In total for my different armies (above summarized as I have different legions), how many do you think I should be ordering?

Finally, I am currently living in Poland, so do you know of any website where I can make a secure purchase without paying too much? Best deal I found this far, in a shop, was around 0,50centsEuro per magnet.

Thanks beforehand for all the tips!",40k

Is anyone else creating or developing a pure first born army? 

If so what are your reasons and what are your plans if you’re army becomes legends in the future? 

I own about 6k points of DW including mainly primaris and I’m now working on a first born army. I think this is the only way I’ll be able to collect two separate marine army’s without having buyers remorse or duplication. 

I’m also setting myself the challenge of only expanding this army via trading or second hand purchases / rescues. I’m currently at 4.5k points and trying to decide on my paint scheme / chapter, currently it’s the Exorcists!

Either way, let me know, if you have tips or tricks,  opinions or thoughts, please share!

We're still learning the game and I have a mind like a sieve for rules minutia so we like to ref. To physical rules every now and then (lol I'd forgotten heroic intervention gives an extra attack for angels of death and marines for example).

We've printed the faq and stuffed it in the back of the rulebook and codex supplements but find we forget about them when searching or re-reading rules.

Do you guys:
1. cut them out and stick them in relevant pages?
2. Just print them and shove them in the back of the book and hope to remember?
3. Print out and shove full page roughly in the right area of the book?
4. Write the update on the relevant pages.. Shudder?
5. Other. Please explain...

If you used to play Gothic or still do give it a look and submit bug reports at tinyurl.com/gothicbug

I just pushed out the release with the fleet lists for imperium so if those aren't right try again in 12-24 hrs. My goal is for gothic to be ready to pick up in battlescribe for anyone. 

Stay tuned to DNDtonight.com to see more of my project in the coming weeks.",40k

### Current FAQs:

**Q: Will there be a digital-only version of the new Codexes?**

A: At this time, GW has not announced any digital-only releases for Codexes. It appears that digital rules will now only be available through the Warhammer 40k App using codes from a physical rulebook.

**Q: When will Battlescribe be updated with the Marine and Necron Codexes?**

A: The data developers have said it may take up to a week after the new Codexes come out for new updates to be released due to the amount of work that needs to be done.",40k

I have contemplated getting into 40K for a long while (almost 10 years, in fact!) and thought current world circumstances would be a good time as any to get acquainted. 

I like to get into new franchises mostly through lore and immersing myself in the world. I briefly perused the subreddit and a few pinned posts for beginners yet could not find anywhere dedicated to providing beginners with lore. Therefore, my first inquiry rests in asking you wonderful people if you could recommend posts or places on this Internet to become familiar with the lore, through the core rules, books, games (board and video), any television or movies or series, or anything I may have left out? 

My second inquiry, possibly less important than the first, but once I do hopefully find somewhere to acquaint myself with the lore, is there a chronological order in which I should be digesting these materials, a canon timeline or content map or preferred order I should explore? I understand there is a ton of content so I am willing to be as patient and considering as possible!

Again, thank you so very much to all of you for your support of newcomers like me, I am amazed at some beautiful miniatures and works some of you have done and am honoured to one day become a member of this wonderful community. Thanks again and I look forward to your replies!",40k

I would really like your input on a few questions, please try to keep your responses semi-serious. I know and do love the fun the community has making memes but I would like to have real genuine responses. Oh and I understand that for a long time GW was a very anti-consumer company but what I've heard in person from hobby veterans is that they've gotten a lot better in the past few years since  the new CEO took over. I guess what I'm trying to say is if you have anything to say about GW please keep the more current company in mind rather than the GW from however many years ago, since the current GW is what new people will deal with.

2. What are things you like about the hobby?
3. What are things you don't like about the hobby?
4. Do you think Warhammer is something that everyone should try out?
5. Do I have to play the game to enjoy the hobby?
6. This sure seems expensive, are there any easy ways to get into the hobby?

I think those are the general questions I have, if you have anything else you'd like to include please do so. I'd really appreciate if you be cordial with your responses, this is to try and help more people get into the hobby after all.

Ive ordered the indomitus box but i wont get it untill December by the looks of it so i dont have the new rule book yet so im having some issues with the army building.

I do have the Space Marine Codex and ive started to plan for the 2k mark.

The issues im having is that i will play the minotaurs chapter as a sucessor to Salamanders.  
Is sucessor the way to go if you like melee and flamers or should i just stright  up go for a chapter of its own?

Do the minotaurs have some special rules? In that case where do i find them? Also i cant find any datasheets or rules for Asterion, Ivanus and Hecaton or their wargear they are offical models with their own wargear. 

Incase of running as Salamander successor im guessing ill have to get their codex?  
Are they getting a 9th edition codex? I dont want to buy the current one and then have to buy the new one in 2 months.

Also since its own chapter can i play with for example grey knight terminator models but with regular terminator rules and they also have Spears.

And on the subject of spears, can i run regular troops with spears and shields instead of chainswords and bolt guns (Or spears and boltguns if shields are not allowed on assult intersessors for ex) What are the rules for this?

Any other tips and trix you can give?

It says that a MODEL gets the benefit of cover while within 3” of the obstacle, unless when you target that model’s unit, that model is unobstructed from the attacker (I.e. my shooting guy can fully see your guy).
So, reading that, it sounds like that MODEL wouldn’t get cover if I can see him. But the rest of his squad would.
So this would mean that if there were 5 models near cover, but one was out, my opponent would have to roll saves one at a time (or, I guess, he could do 4 at a time for the guys IN cover) until either that one guy sticking out (or the four guys in cover) are dead. Then they would roll the rest of the saves together, because they would all be the same save.

Only twice has a body been recovered of this unknown chapter(or legion). The first sightings/event in which this group of warriors is speculated was during the great crusade when remembrancers collected reports. Multiple legions spoke of Gray clad astartes coming to aid. Staying completely silent and moving with a calculated precision against the foes of the emperor that was unachievable  to other legions, this anonymous host made quick work of foes whom had made a stalemate of battlefields. There have been a number of speculations and countless “survivor” records taken, though the only substantiated evidence of this legion/chapters existence was the recovery of two pieces of ceramics. The first found on ullanor, in m31. This was a left arm, shed in gray ceramics with a Roman numeral representing the number 11 on its pauldron.  The bearers arm was still contained. When the geneilogical testing was complete the only clear answer was the birthplace of the astartes. The gene markers pointed to Albia, though their was no record of the gene seed from the Primarchs used to produce this super soldier. This led to great unease amongst the high lords and the Adeptus mechanic ya, leading to one of the greatest cover ups in the history of the imperium. The second sighting and evidence of this “ghost legion” was found on Armageddon. When a mk X helm was recovered from a remote corner or the planet where a patrol of aremgeddon ork hunters became cut off and trapped. Their transport overturned and unable to escape the remaining member simply stated, “ it was as if the hand of the emperor himself blew through orks and righted our taurox.” When the dust had settled and the ork party, whom had attacked the convey, was but pulp and viscera on the earth, is he crew emerged. Nothing remained of the orks, nor the saviours. Nothing save a MK X helm. Grey, plain, and bearing the 11. This particular colour of ceramite has not been seen in centuries and once again left the high lords and Cawl himself in shock. How could a group of the emperors angels go unnoticed, let alone have access to primaris reinforcement! Initially thought to be carcharadons, the first reports make this an impossibility as the chapter was not formed till after the great crusade. Rumour and myth abound. Many speculate these ghosts to be the sons of a forgotten Primarch.",40k

ive gotten back into the hobby due to covid, and im loving it; as a kid i thought necrons were the coolest thing ever, but eventually had to quit because my allowance didnt suffice.

i thought it was so cool i can finally live out the hobby like i always wanted to, since im a working adult now. but it seems like it isnt enough for gw that i am willing to shell out 120 euros for the silent king. the new monolith will be even more than that. the new sons of behemat cost 150 EUROS each. for one miniature. american and australian prices are even worse.

gw has raised the prices multiple times during a crisis in which a lot of people are without jobs, and the whole world is suffering. their stocks have tripled, and they still continue. its indefensible at this point.

i would like to try something different instead of resorting to 3d printing or just leaving the hobby. i want to ask if we can organize something to show them we are not okay with this any longer.

the video gaming community has shown that media attention can help shift a company´s course away from greedy practices, even when those are encouraged by whales. i am confident that we can change something, especially if we get some personalities in the community involved.

i love this hobby, and i dont want to be forced out of it due to monetary reasons like i was before. i would like to stay a part of it. i am willing to pay my fair share, but enough is enough.",40k

In the grimdark future of the 41st millennium, there is only war.

The Imperium of Man was founded to end all wars and unite humanity under a single banner. The galaxy has been at peace for centuries, but that will soon change as the forces of Chaos gather strength once more.

You are an elite Space Marine called a Veteran in the 1 st Company of the Dark Angels. You have fought many battles throughout your long career, but none compare to this one...

It's been five hundred years since the Horus Heresy and you are sent on a mission deep into enemy territory. After a long time spent gathering intelligence, you are to destroy a heretical chapter of the Space Marines known as the Ophidians. They have powerful allies in the form of a huge army of Chaos worshippers and a war-band of Space Marines that served the traitor Horus, known as the War-Sisters.

Your mission will be a sabotage mission, destroying key enemy positions, weapons and defenses in the hopes of weakening the enemy before a grand assault by the armies of the Imperium.

You are a Space Marine with thousands of years of combat training and experience. You will be assisted by Imperial Guard troops, but ultimately it will be you who will be needed to lead them to victory. Can you succeed in your mission? Can you survive the horrors that await you? Will you survive at all?

I'm very new to the hobby and I've been trying to kickstart this whole obsession with tiny plastic models thing. I inherited a massive Custodes army and have been trying to strip them. I have tried everything from simple green soaks to 99% isopropyl and some of the paint and primer are just not coming off. I've just bought an Ultrasonic Cleaner and that has helped somewhat but it appears that during the building part of these models, some of the paint and glue got mixed together and those parts aren't budging. The glue that was used is called ""Axia 025 Gold."" There also appears to be an extensive amount of green stuff mixed with said glue and some of it is just a mess of glue and green stuff.

If anyone has further tips I'd be incredibly grateful. How hot do you guys think the cleaner could get to clean the models without damage? It runs consistently at around 60 C and I run it in 30 minute cycles with 30 - 50 minutes of cooling off. I'm using simple green for now as I do not have enough iso due to the pandemic but I was thinking of maybe trying Superclean in the Cleaner?

With the holidays around the corner it is my goal to give him as much as possible to help him set up his very own tabletop landscape to play the tabletop Warhammer 40k game with. The faction he plays is Chaos Space Marines but I’m more focused on the terrain and building and whatever else I would need to help him get it going, including what’s the best base to put it on (example: I’ve done train sets where the base was plywood and you put terrain on that). The idea I have is a burned down kind of city, that can have a train run through it to give us the best of both worlds. He has paint, spray paint, brushes, holding handles for miniatures, miniatures, a few vehicles for transport, and the glue they use to put them together. What are some other things I can add to get this going for him.

I've picked up a bunch of space marines and started painting. After starting with the standard space marine blue on the first model I found it boring and someone suggested that I could paint them however I wanted and come up with a successor chapter. So now I've been painting with my my own color scheme and have run into a bit of confusion when it comes to Primaris. 

1. Are the Primaris their own chapter, or are they just another type of unit that can be included in a chapter?
2. If the Primaris are their own chapter should i paint them differently like in the standard blue/gold scheme so they are differentiated from the other standard marines?
3. can the Primaris be played as a standard space marine or do they have their own stats that I have to follow?  
4. is it a bad idea to be mixing them now as a new player? should i just stick to collecting standard space marines or the opposite and move toward the Primaris as they seem to be getting all the new support?

I plan on painting in an il-kaith color scheme cause I like the purple and green, with the heavy contrast from the white almost bone like guns. 

My first thought was to make a alaitoc ranger focused detachment for the first escalation something along the lines of

Farseer

Spiritseer 
 
5x rangers

5x rangers

5x rangers

My thought being this will hold objectives well, and be able to pick enemies off.

So I’m looking to get my successor chapter up and running. Originally I had only wanted to take up the painting side of the hobby but over time I’ve decided I want to give my guys a solid back story.

So I’ve done some research and I’m pretty solid on post heresy chapters etc. But with the introduction of Primaris SM and the dwindling of certain chapters/diluting into successors I’m now lost!

Can anybody give a reliable list of the big players as it stands? Ie who are the go to “good guys” and their standard enemies?

I’m wanting my successor chapter to play/mimic the style of Raven Guard but put massive emphasis on quality of natural environments and using them to their advantage (ie stealth) rather than built up cities and techno-heavy environments. 

Therefore I thought a direct rivalry and hatred of death guard would compliment them as they’re polar opposite in terms of toxicity and destruction of planets. Would this make sense in 40k world or not?

Would anybody recommend my chapter being completely primaris based or diluted down from original Raven guard? (I would like to find a way around getting rid of the whole pale emo look too).

All replies welcomed! Thanks.",40k

995,Confused about Smite?,6,ja7gwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/ja7gwf/confused_about_smite/,6,1602596415.0,"Hi all. I'm new to 40k and my question may have an obvious answer but I tend to complicate things further than they need to be.

My nephew and I are for now doing some open play with a start collecting box of orks and tyrannids. His broodlord counts as a psyker. When he casts smite he rolls two D6 dice and if he hits 5 or more the spell casts. Double 1's or 6's he suffers perils of the warp. If it passed he rolls a D3 to determine the amount of wounds. An 11 is D6 for wounds. It's mortal so I can't roll to save it. I understand that part.

What I'm not sure about is how many people get hit? Say he casts smite on my group of 10 boyz. If he rolls a D3 and he gets a 4, that's 2 wounds. Is that just 2 wounds or 2 wounds PER BOY? If it's just 2 wounds then I only remove 2 units cause they each have 1 wound. If it's 2 per boy that's the entire group. Were still learning the rules and we thought smite hits everyone in a group. His broodlord literally clears an entire group of guys under this assumption so I think we may have it wrong.",40k
