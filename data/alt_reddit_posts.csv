I'm hoping to use this experience to springboard into a bigger campaign and I'm playing with pretty experienced players so I don't want to show up to the (virtual) table completely unprepared... I have a rough idea for a character that I feel could use some fine-tuning from more experienced players so I figured I would post it here!  


My Idea for my first Character is that of a ""Dumb"" Paladin. Vehk Valorhardt.  


The Idea is that he grew up as the son of nobility in a very small and isolated town, and was trained as a paladin by the religious order who influenced his father's rule.   


As he grew, he was heralded as a Hero as he accomplished many feats of strength and virtue within the township such as stopping bandits from robbing the tavern, rescuing children lost in the woods, and defeating a wild Dire Wolf that threatened the townsfolk  


However, nothing bad ever happened in this village, most of these feats were orchestrated by his father and his victories were greatly assisted without his knowledge (the bandits and children were actors from a neighboring town, the Dire wolf was fed poisons before he fought it, etc.   


Because of this, he believes himself to be a Mighty Hero, which is fine in the context of his village because nothing bad ever happens there... however an event has caused him to leave his village and seek adventure elsewhere (the reasons for this is still a work in progress) and his tendency to always do the right thing without thinking of consequences (nothing in his life up until now has ever had consequence) and his extreme overestimation of his abilities constantly gets him, and his party,  into trouble.   


  
That's the gist of it anyway, I have a few questions though...

&#x200B;

1. first off like I said I'm a total noob to D&D so before anything else, Is this even a good idea? like as a player or DM would you want to play or DM a character like this?
2. I don't know much about the lore so I'm not sure like where geographically it makes sense to have his village be located... like an area where it would be possible to have an isolated village capable of being a realistic setting for that origin story.
3. also wondering if there are like specific names of religions or religious followers I should be naming or reading up on to reference etc
4. was going to use a standard array for scores STR>CHA>CON>INT>DEX>WIS wondering if that makes sense
5. In reading my beginner's guide it talks about a paladin Oath and im not sure how that all works in the long run...

I'll skip the campaign details they aren't really that important, here's the real meat of our game-ending problem. So Fighter, your average beat-their-face-in jock type and me, a mostly quiet Rouge are interrogating a crow race creature of some sort into telling us where these village raiders could be hiding our wizard checks around the room while her ”assistant” our druid tries to break the walls to find anything that could be hiding inside them. while this is all happening the crow person’s accomplice, a halfling woman walks in to our scene and we grab her up in time to interrogate them both but this is where the problem began.

the fighter went ”can we speed this up? this is taking up all our time”

and I stupidly responded ”you can try screwing her, bet that'll make her spill everythig” smirking 

I was referencing how often the fighter would hit on female npc’s and I feel like some of them knew what I meant but the damage was done and low and behold, the fighter makes the move to have sex with the scared tied up halfling while she begs him to not do it.

the fighter goes ”fork up some answers lady cause we're both in for a good time”

side note: he said cause not or, he's doing this regardless of her telling him or not like the sex is going to be that enjoyable I think I get his point of view here

the wizard's face I actually can't describe correctly but it was anger and disgust or something, the druid couldn't believe it either they're both BFFs btw 

the DM, trying to keep the story from, well, this he conjures guards at the door who hear the begging from outside and the fighter IRL interjects 

”are you kidding me, you pussying out dude?”

the DM once again trying to keep things calm, informs him he needs this to be friendly for everyone ”this scene is making half the party uncomfortable, it's best we just move along” 

the fighter goes ”yea into killing people, sure let's go murder guards or poor mind-controlled mind flyer patients, God forbid a girl gets violated” he throws his arms up dramatically to emphasize 

I go ”this is getting worse” as I go ignored 

the wizard explodes in emotion face red yelling ”I can't fucking believe you'd even say that shit!”

”I knew it!” the fighter screams ” It's only not allowed when it's fuckin personal to you or some shit!”

our cleric to shy to say a word holds her arms in crippling anxiety, looking down as the conversation gets louder 

”you don't know how much that fucking means to people insensitive dipshit” the druid agrees

”Boo hoo ladies!, War is worse then being fucked murder is worse than being fucked, but you’d roll your dice and shit all excited its fucking going down!”

“War isnt a monster violating the deepest most vulnerable parts of you!!” Screams wizard 

“Yea cause its happening to the whole fucking country sweetheart!, in mass, but it only makes you cry when it touches all the parts of your sensitive bullshit is your witch a murderer or an activist bitch pick one!!”


“How about both you black-hearted asshole!!”
the wizard screams the loudest actually in tears this time 

side note: that was very deep for her she really did cry like that hurt her but I think only me and DM understood it from like a guys perspective 

the DM has had enough and call an end to the campaign taking off his glasses rubbing his nose bridge  

the wizard storms off still in tears the druid slamming the table befoee following crying wizard

”you happy princess! you fucked it up for everybody, over a pretend lady in a fantasy game was it worth it? fucking hell!”

we all leave truly hurt and disappointed because I made a stupid joke oi vey 

that was really fun though the conversation about morals in dnd it was pretty eye-opening despite the very insensitive fighter(my opinion)  

I propose the question to you, 5e monsters can truly be absurd, but does that make all crimes 
less absurd should we care for them like how we do now? or are they less absurd because there are worse things in dnd itself?

you still get the sweet extra ability score improvements from being a fighter, but it's not as pivotal to max strength, dexterity and constitution like the usual fighter class requires.

It was just too creative and wonderful an idea for me to pass up (especially because the player in question is usually just the quiet babysitter of the group while the other two commit hijinks) so I allowed it and, two very strong deception rolls later, my changeling player actually took Strahd's second waifu bite in Ireena's place.
I was hoping people might have some ideas on how I can work this. How strahd might react upon realising his best girl isn't actually ready for the big wedding he'd planned and how my changeling might be affected by this. I don't know if they're gonna be sticking with the body double long-term but the character is currently travelling in Ireena's form so she may end up being taken herself.
It's not a huge issue really but I was looking for some creative possibilities if anyone has any :)",dnd

In a few games I've played in and one I DMed, the party was pretty good about being team players with loot, whether it be dividing up gold, giving an item they don't need to a party member who DOES need it, or just using the gold and items for the benefit of the party instead of beefing up their own character.

In other games there's been 1 or 2 players with a finders keepers mentality where they rush to the treasure chest or slain enemies to be the first to lay claim to it, causing weird imbalances where 1 character has 4 or 5 magic items (some of which they don't really need) and everyone else has none.",dnd

Ever since young age she devoted herself to the church, she's been told her whole life that she won't be anything worthy, that she's an evil traitor — she wanted to 'clean herself' from the things her ancestors did, who got them all into this in the first place. She wants to prove how loyal she can actually be by becoming an acolyte in a church who believes in ___ (the Deity will be discussed with the DM, but the God/Goddes will probably be LG). At first she's an unimportant figure at her church, but then takes on the paladin training, wanting to go into the world and prove her devotion. Here's the catch, though, ever since she was little, she heard a voice in her head, a low tempting whisper, which tried to make her see the truth — she only has one real master, and it's the same entity that her ancestors betrayed. She usually talks as herself (by using mimicry of course, but she is expressing her own thoughts), but sometimes the temptations just overwhelm her and it's not her who's talking anymore..
Well, here's just the core of her character, I might change things up, but what do you think so far? What name do you think would be the best? I'm really bad at giving names to my characters (one of my characters is named Pico van Chico, I mean come on), so this would help a lot!",dnd

The main premise of the side campaign is that we’re all kobolds, and we’ve been trying to unite all the kobold tribes in the area and protect ourselves from dragons.

okay my first problem hold person is a wisdom saving throw?  on roll20 wisdom is seen to be perception, insight etc. so why is it a wis saving throw rather than a dex saving throw which is reflexes and agility . + all charming saving throws are charisma which i think of as force of personality . Shouldn't it be wis which is insight being able to see through someone's hypnotic gaze as an example

my second problem is that ability scores are way too broad . For instance i want to make a high wisdom character that focuses on insight just because he has a high wisdom like 20 i would be as good at medicine as a 3rd-level cleric even though i never studied medicine or nature. 

my third  problem is with proficiency (mainly for roleplaying) . if i made a party of rogues at level one some of them i believe would be better at stealth and others may be better at sleight of hands but  unless the other party members intentionally under power themselves by not taking proficiency in stealth they'll all be exactly the same.

56,Need help creating a Fey ritual,2,jffzew,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/jffzew/need_help_creating_a_fey_ritual/,0,1603325866.0," Hi! I'm a first-time DM for dnd 5e, just finished DMing my first campaign ever in All Flesh Must Be Eaten, and really enjoyed it, so did my players! So I'm jumping over to dnd 5e to try that out, admittedly a system I'm a lot more well-versed in.

I'm in the process of finalising some of my worldbuilding, the lore and history is fairly complete, just fleshing it out and making it seem real, but to give you the short and sweet of it concerning the question: About a 100 years before the campaign starts, a great blight falls upon the lands, believed to be caused by magic and the presence of Fey throwing the balance between the Astral, Material and Fey plane out of whack, a lot of other stuff happened in reaction but one of the important affects (effects?) was that the Fey were hunted and removed from the land in large numbers. Flash forward a 100 years later and suprisingly, the Fey want back in, and there are several ways they can do this but one of the main plot-centered ways is a ritual to be performed to restore the Fey Queen of Spring's (a little more homebrew, I know it was originally a dude) crown, which has been split into 7 and aspects of it lay across the land.

My question being: Any ideas of what these pieces should be? And encounter ideas surrounding them? I have a few already but am up for ideas and criticisms - I like the idea of them being something that can be useful to the players as a little reward for stopping the ritual. Also is there a number that is more thematic than 7 to the Fey?

My current ideas:

* The untranslatable diary of the Queen of Air and Darkness – Holds the secrets and instructions to the ritual  - Obviously this isn't the one of seven, but needs to be found to complete the ritual
* A braid of unicorn hair
* A sapphire ring with a shard of burning starlight (*Ring of three wishes)* 
* A translucent Conch shell
* A raw sliver of a gold dragon’s heart that never spoils (*Potion of flying)* 
* Amber Gem of the Open Heart 
* The hilt of the Bane of the Feywild (A legendary weapon that was believed to have destroyed the crown in the first place)

We're rolling a Halloween 1 shot where we play as our costume, and since I am traditionally the DM and I get to play for once... I'm still the DM in costume. So I'm outsourcing- what character/race/class/etc. should I run with to fulfill said costume/idea?

Constraints for character creation:

* Level 15
* Any official WoTC material (no UA)
* 2 Rare Magic Items **or** 1 Very Rare and 3 Uncommon

My thoughts have been the following:

&#x200B;

* Bard- fits thematically as the teller of tales, though potentially a wee bit underpowered for what I'm going for.
* Wizard- give me those spells and the power I oh-so-desire!
* Warlock 1 (Hexblade)/Fighter 5(Battle Master)/Paladin 2/Bard 7(Eloquence)- Multiclassed Isanity that allows me to do way too much in a single turn (Divine Smite + Multi Attack with Action Surge, using my Charisma modifier! Could change the Bard to some type of Rogue, however, to get Sneak Attack.

Her alignment is currently Neutral Good. Her background had her raised by a master human vampire hunter who was a high ranking member of a good aligned church. She hates undead and, by extension, resents her existence and believes she is a monster but tries to help others and protect the weak from the creatures of the night. 

While she has the Dayborn racial trait and isn't harmed by the sun, she still can't be healed by the parties cleric or other conventional means. Mostly I have to use inflict light wounds on her to heal or buy a homebrew potion used by other Dhampir in the setting to heal. (Mostly just a vial of Dhampir blood). Recently, an NPC advised her to try adding a bit of her blood to a vial of holy water to create unholy water to heal herself. The party has access to an inquisitor who can make the holy water, but my vampire hunter can also do this as she has inquisitor spells. 

My question is if this is an evil act that would alter her alignment. She knows it is a blasphemous act to corrupt the holy water and really doesn't want to do it. However, her experiences in the Dread Realm have shown that she is at a disadvantage in combat because the cleric not only can't heal her, but also threatens to harm her whenever they try to kill hostile undead. The Dhampir potions cost about as much as a equally powerful healing potion, but getting them isn't always an option. I have been going with the belief that the corruption of the holy water is a small price to pay for her ability to stay on her feet in order to continue to doing more good for those around her.

We haven't actually started playing yet, so it wasn't too big a deal, but the problem is thematics for the subclass at level 3. Shadow just leads down the same rabbit hole of double rogues, Drunken Master and Kensei don't fit, and apparently Open Hand was ""too boring"" so the choice was between lightning-flavoured Sun Soul or Four Elements. (I'm restricting their choices to PHB & XGtE because otherwise it's too overwhelming). Currently he's leaning towards Four Elements, but that doesn't work brilliantly because that encompasses a lot of different things, and he wants his character to be electricity-based, and have healing if possible, as the only possible way the party can heal is the Bard's limited spell slots.

So this is where my dilemma lies. I want to create a Monk Tradition, that is based off lightning and storms, but not stepping on Storm Sorcery too much. We've resolved the healing issue with his character having limited knowledge of healing potions (mechanically his do 1d4+2 instead of 2d4+2) but the Tradition aspect is really puzzling me. Help would be much appreciated.

The all-female assassin's guild known as the Qutila’Muhlik has the highest concentration of power in the coastal city of Shimmerscale. These sisters of death pose as high-end escorts and prostitutes, and it is not surprising that most of the guild’s owned property are brothels.

Each sister receives a shining, black steel dagger when they are born into the guild. They use this dagger exclusively for contract killings. After the contract has been completed, the name of the victim is engraved into the metal of the blade. The sister in question decides how large she wants the engraving to be, but once both sides of the metal are filled with names, the blade is intentionally shattered and the sister is forced to leave the guild to start a new life. A shattered blade is buried, wrapped in cloth with the sister's name embroidered on it. The sister ‘dies’ when her blade is buried, and she has to choose a new name for herself. A clean slate, away from the Qutila’Muhlik. At this point, her debt is repaid and she is never allowed to return nor to take the life of any person ever again.

The blade is forged from a metal mined deep in the ocean by the merfolk. It has a dark blue, almost midnight sheen to it when the light catches it just right. The steel will also never rust or tarnish.

The metal is also rather strong, and will only shatter when the right amount of twisting force is simultaneously applied to the tip of the blade and the center of the blade, a few inches above the hilt.

A lost or stolen blade is rare, but if a sister does lose her blade for some reason she is exiled from the Qutila’Muhlik until she can recover it. Once recovered she is allowed to return to the fold, but she will be disgraced for the rest of her life with the guild.

An unshattered, stolen, or otherwise acquired blade is worth quite a bit of gold to the right collector.

About to join a new AL campaign/group playing through Rime of the Frostmaiden.

I have been playing pen&papers since 6ish years and dnd specifically since 1,5 years. so I would say I am pretty solid on mechanics and ""how to roleplay"".
joining a new group shouldn't be an issue and character building isn't either... mechanically.

but all the experience I have in dnd is within homebrew worlds that share nothing with the Forgotten Realms and I barely know anything about the lore (except a few snippets).

I wanted to play a Githyanki wizard (going melee, possibly Bladesinger if Tasha's lifts the Elf restriction for AL) and I have built the char on dndbeyond already.

but I am a bit lost on the background part. I read the wiki about Gith and know their history with the Illithid, about the -yanki and -zerai schism, Vlaakith etc.
however I don't know how to come up with a believable, meaningful reason why my Githyanki wizard would end up in the Icewind Dale campaign, where he comes from and why he's alone and joining the party.
my lack of knowledge about Faerun makes this really hard and I am a bit lost where to read up on stuff without having to crunch through tons of wikis.

without knowing Faerun lore: how would a Githyanki end up in the Frostmaiden campaign and what's a good basic backstory for him?",dnd

Hey guys, I'm fairly new to DnD and have thought of a concept for a character.

More often than not, when I make a character based on an idea or two that i had thought of and evolved, I think it sounds really good until i put pen to paper, finding out its actually horrible.

If anybody would like to give me a second opinion before i finish off and finalize this character, I would love to hear it, I am open to suggestions.

So anyway, here goes. (please bear with me, i am a TERRIBLE story teller)

The character I have put together is a female human, whom i will call Faika for now (don't ask why, just a random name).

Faika is a farm girl from a very poor village. This village neighbors a forest that is home to a few weak beasts, however with no help of capable fighters, many lives have been lost to those that stray out of the forest and attack innocents.

Faika and her father have had to live off a small plot of land that can barely feed the two while also paying for the land (mother is unknown and has no known siblings). Her father is actually a very knowledgeable man and despite the enormous workload needed to pay of land and live, he managed to home school her almost every day and gave her the knowledge that many people in the village could never have. In her younger days she would see her friends and often share some of these packets of knowledge with them.

being such a poor and small village, everybody got on well, learning to help each other when possible and sharing any available resources to each other.

While this backstory isn't very impressive, i thought it'd work for why she becomes an adventurer.

She becomes an adventurer when her father becomes deathly ill (or kidnapped by higher power for some reason, remember this is still in the works) and the land is not enough to pay for a service to heal him (or pay the ransom). The only job that she can think of being profitable enough quickly enough is the role of adventurer, putting her life on the line for coin despite never having any experience of violence, killing, or harming others.

The class i ended up choosing for her is the druid class. I believe that a good enough reasoning behind this would be an encounter with a dire wolf in the neighboring forest. Whilst being young an dumb, she adventures into the forest, despite all warnings, thinking this huge forest is gorgeous, she ventures deep inside, where the danger increases, eventually, she comes across a large wolf, at first she is terrified and fall over backwards (cliche style) until finally realizing that the wolf means no harm to her. After calming down and getting closer to the wolf, she is allowed to pet it, ride it and so on. after hours of lost time in playing in the woods she can hear the yelling of her father, screaming her name, along with a multitude of the other villagers, looking for her. Riding piggy back on her new friend she returns to her father and villagers, whom are obviously threatened and terrified of the creature, convinces them all to spare it and all go home. Scolded all the way back and grounded (as you do).

Throughout the years growing up she constantly snuck into the forest to be with the wolf, talking to the other creatures of the forest too and befriending them, eventually learning that she can commune with them (or whatever else she can as a druid). Despite learning that she has such a power, she didn't get chance to train with it or anything of the sort due to the huge workload her and her father still had to endure.

Sorry, that was a lot of backstory, i like writing them lol.

now into stats.

i wanted a heavy RP character instead of a very...amazing one, i chose to allocate stats (point buy system) into what i thought would fit her background, 16 str, 13 dex, 15 con, 14 int, 10 wis, 10 cha. my reasoning is under here.

16 in strength (manual labor from farming, digging etc) 13 in dexterity (i felt that this would fit from the manual labor an constant running around in a trip hazard full forest) 15 constitution (again, running round in a thick forest would cause a lot of build up from falls, trips, scrapes and so on, also the labor would have helped endurance if that makes sense) 14 intelligence (from her brilliant father) 10 wisdom (i understand that this is an important stat for a druid but i believe that it would suit her as a naive girl being out of the village for the first time out of resource runs to other villages and towns) and finally 10 charisma (I she her being very likable however not knowing how to talk to people out of her small circle of people and animals).

as for equipment she has simple leather armor, a sickle (from the farm), a spear, a spig of mistletoe as a druidic focus and a simple kit consisting of a tinderbox, bedroll, mess kit, 50 ft of rope, a day of rations and a backpack.

Also this character isn't meant as a ""i need money so i joined the druids"" character, she just sorta is one, not knowing what she is. I'm thinking of adding some backstory as an adventurer before a campaign, being that she found a fellow druid, whom showed her how to actually use her magic, but she doesn't actually join a circle per say.

If there's anything you'd think i should change or add I'm all ears.

And if you don't have any suggestions, I'd still love to hear your opinions :)

Also if anybody is looking for players I'm still looking for a group haha....",dnd

I've been playing in this campaign for almost a year now, and while the DM is great and the rest of the players have been super fun to play with there's one player that's ruining it completely for me.

The first few sessions were fine, we met up in character and set off on our adventure! It slowly got worse from there, however, when it became incredibly clear that this character was this person's self insert character. While normally that's fine, she takes every dispute IN character VERY personally and will metagame to try and fix every conflict by telling the other players she's in the right and that our PCs have no right to be upset. Or she'll hear OOC that our character took a situation poorly when we talk after session about everything for fun and she'll go to fix it in character despite us telling her she doesn't know in character several times. She'll consistently be extremely aggressive in and out character, stealing from peasants who've done nothing to her and beating them up (despite the fact that she's CG) and will yell at players who call her out for being mean. Not to mention that, after 3 years of playing D&D, she has her BF do all of her character sheet stuff for her and doesn't know almost any of the basic mechanics. It gets so bad that her turns in combat can last up to 30 minutes, and it isn't helped by the fact that she barely uses her class features, instead opting to try and always use improvised weapons to do random stuff in combat. She also interrupts frequently to go off on long tangents or tell jokes that can interrupt us for even longer, even talking over and during people's turns. When the DM tells her to be quiet or tells her no in session she will ARGUE with him for EVEN LONGER. When we try to do the same she's yelled at us in the past and made us feel bad for doing so.

We've talked to the DM about this several times, and he's said that he has talked with her, but it's been a year and nothing has changed. In fact it's gotten worse. He won't even stand up to her most of the time because I'm sure he doesn't wanna upset his GF. I have no idea what to do at this point, and I'm so frustrated that I'm close to dropping out despite not wanting to because literally everything else about the campaign is perfect. I'm not the only player with this opinion and want to leave because of her, and at this point she won't listen. She takes criticism EXTREMELY poorly, when we approached her once she told us we were wrong and twisted the situation in her favor by claiming it was different than it was. She never grows from anything because she refuses to be wrong. Not to mention she blames all of this on mental health issues, which multiple of us ALSO have. It's not an excuse.

Do I have any options? Or am I doomed to have to leave?

tldr; DM's GF is ruining a campaign I love with her horrible attitude and unwillingness to change and I don't know what to do other than leaving.",dnd

140,Using Abilities Outside of Rolls,3,jf9urv,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/jf9urv/using_abilities_outside_of_rolls/,10,1603302448.0,"Idea came from reading a post about whether active Perception checks negate Passive Perception or whatever. If I know a PC has a certain skill bonus, I'd let them automatically pass certain things that PCs lacking bonuses to that skill might have to roll for. For instance, someone with +8 Athletics/Acrobatics might be ablye to jump/vault over a 5ft mossy wall with no issue, but a player with a -1 to those skills would roll. This is kind of like using Passive Abilities: if their passive (10+ modifier) would succeed, then no need to roll. Someone's whose passive would auto-fail (-1 Dex Cleric say) can roll to have a chance at getting lucky/observing the others and recreating and passing. For instance, you wouldn't expect a trained gymnast to have a 50/50 chance of failing to do a cartwheel, whereas you might doubt the ability of the overweight couch potato (who still might be able to do one, but is a lot less likely). Of course, if someone is trying to do something very difficult or out of their comfort zone (trying to backflip over an enemy and stab them) I'd ask for a roll, but again that would be because the DC is higher than their passive. Likewise, if someone who has a Passive Perception is actively looking for a bird in the sky, I'm not going to make them roll and on less than 10 Deus Ex Machina some reason they fail (a twig is blown into your eye, or you're strangely captivated by a brightly coloured leaf). This is my not-so hot take on using skill rolls (also allowing this means players don't always bandwagon rolling the same thing, saving roll time and letting character builds feel impactful without alway relying on the dice).

Edit: Certain things might raise/lower their passives. For instance, party's PP might be lowered if they're in a noisy crowded place, or if they're carrying a lot of gear that wall might be harder to get over. Using discretionary things like this can increase the number of rolls if players like rolling, but I personally don't like rolling for things I think my character could do 99/100 times.",dnd

First post so sorry about any mistakes!

So my 5e party of six managed to become stuck on the Astral Sea at level 5. They have a Cleric, Fighter, Wizard, Bard, Rogue, Sorcerer and an 'adopted' four year old who has been pulled along with them. I've looked through the MM, DMG, MtoF, VgtM, XgtE and even the Tome of Beasts by Kobold Press but I can't seem to find much other than the gith, the astral dreadnaught and a few others who are far too powerful for them. 

Does anyone have any ideas on what might be an interesting combat encounter for them? I already have some different out of combat encounters and challenges but I want to know what else might be found in this INFINITE EXPANSE. Thank you!

Over the last couple of months I have DMed and played with multiple groups, online and offline (as COVID has permitted) and I found myself spending every free moment preparing my sessions. Many could say this led to DM burnout, but this post is not about that. 

Instead, I found myself fleeing from my real life. I did not like several things that were happening for me, regarding private problems as well as the ongoing pandemic. The fantastic games and stories that we experience and share based on the D&D framework are great to escape from reality from time to time, but I stopped solving problems and confronting things that were bothering me, because I'd rather work on the next session or play D&D. 

I consider myself quite lucky, because I noticed this behaviour and was strong enough to turn the situation around and started working on the problems themselves. I started working out to get back into physical shape as this also does wonders for mental health. Furthermore, I had some very intense discussions with my SO and this ended in both of us reviewing how we treat each other and now being happier than ever.... and the amount of sex has about quadrupled, so that was definitely worth it. Also, I took work more seriously and was able to complete a project that was very successful and put me into a even more interesting position in my job.

And still, I play D&D and lots of it, because I love it. Though I have toned down the amount of prep I do and DM less and play more, so I actually have time for all the other lovely and important things life has to offer. Maybe take this as a good moment to reflect on what you are doing. Are you happy? Are you lieing to yourself like I was? Are you hiding? What can you do to make it better?

I never thought I was at risk of suffering from mental health problems, but the pandemic and the influence it has on everyday life has probably taken its toll. Be safe, be healthy.",dnd

The twins grew up strong and proud, one is the paladin, strong and kind, he is loyal to his family and duty, the other, a foolhardy, cold and headstrong but with a big heart barbarian, both in constant rivalry with the other, but otherwise considered to be the best friend to the other. One faithful day, one died,  murdered by unknown assailant, on his deathbed, the other mourned and vowed for justice/revenge, taking his twin's ring in exchange for his own, along with other equipment, he set off the find the murderous bastard.

C1 is lv8 Paladin, C2 is lv8 Barbarian. Similar in build, but with a few subtle differences. C1 is inside the ring, C2 is alive. Using the Path of the Beast subclass, the barbarian is suddenly cursed with the blood of an ancient blue dragon, with each rage making him grow in size with lightning all over him, but renders him uncontrollable sometimes, with the aid of his brother, managed to control the rage.

Question:

1. What traits would the barbarian inherit in an ancient blue dragon? (Path of the Beast)
2. Should the character fall and get revived, is there a possibility of one soul entering the body and the other in the ring. (Soul-Switch)
3. On the same note, if C1's soul entered C2's body, would he be able to use his paladin skills/spells in a barbarian body?
4. What would happen to their alignment if say, against his brother's wishes, C2 in rage, utterly destroys another. or C1 in C2's body does something very lawful and honorable true to his name. (EX-Class)
5. If an event caused their souls to merge fully, become one with the other, what would be the result? Can their classes merge Barbarian/Paladin?
6. If the Ring is not applicable, is there another item that could do this?
7. Also, is there an item that could make them switch souls.

Lets say you are a 11th level wizard and a 6th level Artificer can you get two homunculus, I think you can.  Receiving one with the spell ""Create Homunculus"" and one with the Infusion ""Homunculus Servant"".  With out a doubt you cannot get two with just infusions or spells, but mixing them is a little different.  Yes I understand the last line in the spell and how Infusions work but hear me out.

Okay the spell stops you from having two with this line,

* You can have only one homunculus at a time. If you cast this spell while your homunculus lives, the spell fails.

and the Infusions stop you this way.

* each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time
* Also at no point that I could see was there mention of The spell Create Homunculus.

Some other things about Infusions 

* Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the  infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your  Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day).
* All of the Infusions are described as ""The magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items"".  

Can you make a Homunculus Servant (which is a prototype) then cast Create Homunculus, would the Servant register to stop the spell from working?

What effects and properties would it have? The effects can get wacky so go wild.

For context I am planning on running and currently writing a one shot adventure in a dungeon with a food based twist. It's all based on [this](https://roll4tarrasque.itch.io/baktos-terrifying-cuisine) little two page pamphlet that greatly inspired me to write what is looking like a very creative and fun adventure.

The party needs to collect ingredients to cook an original meal in order to please the demon lord of the dugeon. 
Since it's set in a giant's dungeon everything is supersized by a factor of ~4.

I have devised a room which is a dilapidated pantry that has been flooded and infested with a glowing cyan mold. The source is a moldy wheel of cheese tucked away in a cabinet at the far end of the room and the party need to crawl through the room to get to it.

In this dungeon interesting ingredients and magic is what the party is after and they will get a lot of both. I need to find a way to make the cheese itself what they are after in this room! Any ideas on how to make the weird glowing moldy cheese a worthy magical reward and ingredient in cooking? What would it's attributes be? 

*As examples here are some other ingredients*

**Moon Water:** Anything that touches it is in moon gravity and drinking it causes a never ending thirst.

**Ghosts Peppers:** The contain the souls of the dead and are incredibly hot.

**Unicorn Butter:** Switches the flavor of things to their opposite.

It is very useful to have an extra four hours when you are a magic-obsessed elf. 

That is four hours that can be used to short rest with and understand 2+ magical items in your possession without forcing the party to wait up for you. That is four hours you can use to copy a spell from a scroll or spellbook. It is 4 extra hours to perform any rituals you need which last a while (find familiar). Not to mention it is time to do things which are more universal. Send that familiar out scouting, while doing some arcane study. I honestly think that high elves are the best wizards. Extra cantrip (especially handy early game), good modifiers, other abilities like dark vision (granted, which are common [but absent in the much beloved human]), and some extra time to do things which are especially useful for wizards.

The following ideas have already been proposed to the players and they think they’re cool

So far I have:

The campaign is set in the year 2050 and humans only recently (2030) discovered magic. Now that the humans are learning to master magic, all the magical creatures are beginning to reveal themselves, starting with the elves and the dwarves, then the halflings and the gnomes, etc. But as the friendly creatures reveal themselves, so too do the not so friendly ones. This is a timeline where Faerun and Earth have collided. There will be plenty of classic dnd quests and non-hacking stuff, but plenty of modern and futuristic twists too with plenty of hacking. Are you a human discovering the strange new thing called magic? Or are you from Faerun and trying to understand all the new technology?

Some of the classic dnd spells also have a hacking variant:

Message (cantrip) = text message

Fireball = EMP Blast

Scrying = Tracing chip

And some classes have a new hacking subclass:

New subclass of wizard can add a quadcopter to their list of potential familiars

New subclass of cleric can also heal constructs (such as the quadcopter)

New subclass of rogue is harder to detect when they’re hacking into something

New subclass of artificer can create viruses and malware

The following has not yet been proposed to the players: 

New warlock subclass where your patron is Big Data, where they provide you with some tools and skills for hacking in return for some of the data you find",dnd

I’m there to deal damage and take a few hits. Well one of my friends, granted they all are, is playing a war cleric currently. He’s wound up being the healer of the group even though part of D&D he loves most is the combat. He wants to get in there and fight and deal as much damage as possible, but being the only person who can heal in the group is keeping him from doing so. I should add were level three currently, but the combat has been challenging even though it’s a ton of fun because it’s challenging. I don’t think we’ve made it out of an encounter without someone going unconscious yet. So because of this I made a backup character that is a designated healer, a divine soul sorcerer (cause I really want to play one). This past session he nearly died and I’ll repeat, he’s the only healer among us. I created my eldritch knight with a backstory I’m proud of and am looking forward to playing through. So right now my issue is what do I do? I feel bad that he has to heal the party when he wants to fight instead and I have no issue with being a designated healer, but I’m not dead. And multiclassing into cleric or something with the current character wouldn’t make sense and I’m more of a story centric guy so I can’t do that. I don’t really want to hear “you can play without a healer” not to be rude, but I’ve told him that a few times already and he understands, but he’s nice enough to heal since he’s the only one that really can. I want to know what you guys would do to try and help. Cause I’m tempted to dump the character I’m playing now to help out and be a healer, even though I really really don’t want to do that. I don’t expect expert answers and I would understand if everyone just said “that’s tough” but this subreddit exists so I figured I’d ask",dnd

I am not looking for solely damage dealing items, and I know there are some restrictions to how much area can be affected with 4oz of substance, but I'm really aiming for some fun RP opportunities.

221,The Wild Magic Fun Bag Nightmare,5,jf3fdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/jf3fdj/the_wild_magic_fun_bag_nightmare/,2,1603272651.0,"So to set the scene: I’m DMing this pretty serious 5e homebrew campaign, but I like to throw in some fun items every now and again for my characters to use. WAY back at Level 4, the Fighter picked up a bag that I liked to call the “Wild Magic Fun Bag.” It was filled with 10 pinches of Wild Magic essence, 20 random possibilities assigned to a table I created when you threw it at a target. I gave it to the party as a  little fun party trick that mostly didn’t do any damage, and they had no idea what effects it could do.

So let’s flash forward to what happened last session. The party (now level 9) was ambushed by the Rogue’s ex girlfriend and his old rival from the organization of assassins he was once a part of, so the fight was supposed to culminate in this emotional and difficult fight that left the party on their last legs. Accompanying the assassins were 3 mages that had ties to the plot later on, and they were meant to teleport the assassins in, and then Counterspell or dispel any AoEs so they could spread out, before teleporting away to be enemies later on in the game. The party was outmatched on purpose, but I had some last help planned to turn the tide.

Then Fighter says, “I have an idea, and it’s kind of a risk, I have something in my inventory I wanna use.” I gave him a confused look, until I realized what he was referring to.

Oh. Oh no.

So the Fighter proceeds to empty the entire bag of Wild Magic onto one of the assassins, who is standing between two of the mages at the time. So we had to roll 10 d20s and pick 10 different random effects to apply to the target. What happened next can only be described as absolute chaos.

The assassin had 10 random effects applied to him, which all lasted a single round. Since all the effects applied simultaneously, they all ended after one round. The most notable effects included the following: he gained a +10 modifier to CON, turned invisible, had his body emit extremely bright radiant light in a 50 foot radius, was given a badass beard of fire and glowing fiery eyes, turned into a Tarrasque that couldn’t move or take actions, and threw up 300 gold, which he then had to make a CON save for or pass out.

So in the span of 6 seconds, this badass, intimidating assassin turned into a Tarrasque with a flaming beard that was simultaneously invisible and glowing like the sun. This transformation instantly crushed the mages next to him to death (I gave them names and everything for them to be important later, and they’re just turned to jelly). And this isn’t where it ends. Remember the +10 bonus to CON? That gives a +20 to this Tarrasque’s CON save that he has to make to not pass out after throwing up a bunch of gold. He rolls a *Natural 1* and straight up crushes a forest passing out (I like to do critical fumbles/successes for skills to add some fun).

By the way, one of the effects actually affected the Fighter, and he turned into a cloud of gas. I naturally had both of them take some psychic damage after seeing the laws of physics implode from that Wild Magic Fun Bag. And the only remaining mage noped out after that. 

Despite the complete tonal shift that this gave the fight, it still managed to end in an emotional way, so not all was lost. But poor Yannick and Licanus, the future villains that never got to be...

The lesson to be learned here for DMs: never give your party something like this and assume they’ll use it in a funny situation. They will use it in the most inopportune moment possible, likely way into the campaign and during the middle of a serious moment.

TL;DR: In the middle of a serious, emotional fight, the Fighter used the Wild Magic Fun Bag, turning one of the enemies into a Tarrasque that was simultaneously invisible and glowing like the sun, had a fire beard, threw up gold, and then passed out. Future enemy NPCs were turned into paste.",dnd

Please be respectful.

Hello everyone, 

So, it seems to me that sometime around 2018 a big push began in Wizards of the Coast for good gender and race representation. Before then, it clearly wasn't on the top of their minds (like how the Vistani in Curse of Strahd were Romani stereotypes and how Chult in Tomb of Annihilation is just African stereotypes + dinosaurs). For the record, I don't think it was malicious, I just think they didn't really know better at the time. Now, they're actively making an effort to fix their mistakes and promote positive racial representation (Here's a statement they made about it: [https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/diversity-and-dnd](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/diversity-and-dnd)). 

This push likely began sometime after Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes. Page 39 talks about how the drow basically don't get to go to elf heaven on the basis of their race, which is kinda yikes in my opinion. 

However, I think it was likely before Waterdeep: Dragon Heist. It still isn't great with the drow, (there are quite a lot of them, and based on my memory and some skimming they seem to be all villains), but there is some great LGBTQ+ representation (I'll admit I'm cis straight male, so my perspective may be a bit warped by lack of knowledge, but it looks good to me) and the 3 street urchin kids were written the way they were specifically for representation. I read this some time ago, though I'll admit I can't find the source anymore. Also it doesn't seem like a coincidence to me that Nat is deaf, Jenks is black and obese (I'm sorry if that's not the polite term, I don't know what it is), and Squiddly is a tiefling (the most oppressed race in the lore) and partially blind. 

Mordenkainen's and Dragon Heist came out in May and September of 2018 respectively, which seems to me like too short a timeframe for such a drastic change to happen naturally. So my question is: What may have caused that change in WotC? Did they hire someone who persuaded them to do this? Did some controversy happen? Were they inspired by political events at the time? Or was it something else entirely?

They where forced into a war as dispensable soldiers, fighting another Empire who claimed to unite all races and cleanse every prejudice. The small Clan was exterminated in the fighting and the little Dullahan was sealed in a magical amulet, prisioner for eternity. 

Whoever wore the amulet and were in a dire situation would summon, even without knowing,   
the little dullahan who will be binded to protect and serve his new master until the end of his lifegoal and after that she will return to be a magical amulet.

Centuries pass and the amulet keeps changing owner and the little dullahan,summon after summon,  grows in a formidable warrior at the cost of her own sanity forgetting her past, friends and family, becoming just another tool in the shed to whoever summoned her.  
One day, the little dullahan (who is a pc to clarify) gets summoned again by a colourfull group of adventurers and starts to fight along their side on a quest to solve the murder of the current emperor. For the first time in a long time her new master treats her like a human being and she's starting to develop a bond of friendship with the group...until;

They find some clues about a secret cult who may have something to do with the murder and decided to storm their base searching for anything usefull, deep in this dungeon they find a trinket who appear to have some magic proprieties and the little dullahan volunteers to wear that since her kind is widly known to be resisent to such kind of magic. Once on her wrist her mind is flooded by countless voices who keeps calling her ""little sister"" and such, asking her to run to them, to reunite. Apart from that the trinket appear to be harmless and when removed everything returns to normal.

Then the group is attacked by giant spiders and yadi yada yada thei keep descending into the dungeon. After another attack the little dullahan separates from the group running forward looking for an exit and when she's alone..sbam...the magic trinket charms her assuming control of her body guiding her in a large oval room. The group fend off the giant spiders and start searching for her, finding her in that room by herself, on her knees with a big smile and tears all over her face.

The group decide that the trinket must have something to do with this and the cleric (pc neutral chaotic) claim that the most secure way to free her from the spell is to chop off her arm. Yes, it is the only way, chop all her arm off...she's a dullahan so she can reattach it later on no biggies.   
They argue a bit but in any case as soon as someone gets near her a giant spider-humanoid queen jumps down from the roof on the tank of the group incapacitating him (he was really low on hp already). A boss fight breaks out and they manage to take that damn trinket off away from the little dullahan freeing her from the charm. She also starts to fight but just after one round the queen ask her ""Weren't you happy before these fools came in here taking you away from me?"" and kisses her charming her AGAIN. The little dullahan answer ""Yes"" to the queen and under the spell control starts to protecting her from any harm. The group then decide to take the little dullahan out without killing her so that they could focus on the boss and they manage to incapacitate her. Apart from being a human shield she didn't ever attack a single time any of them. While the group fights the queen the little dullahan fails 2 of 3 save check. The cleric pc healing the group midfight has the opportunity to stabilize her but he refuses to do so. They manage to kill the queen and the group finds out that the pc cleric thinks that she's a traitor having heard her say ""Yes"" to the queen question and for that she must die. The whole group almost beg the pc Cleric to save her so that she might answer their questions about her fighting alongside the queen boss against them and after some efforts he finally agrees...but fails the medicine check. She dies and the cleric takes her jewels and start looting corpses.

The little dullahan is no more. 

The game session ends and everyone at the table (exept the cleric pc) is a little shaken by the loss of a comrade.  The little dullahan player took his character's death serenely, all considered, knowing that it may happen in any game to anyone. But...  
The DM ruled that after his action the cleric alignment shifted to Neutral Evil and that there are likely to be consequences.  
The Cleric refuses his ruling claiming to be in the right for hating betrayal and that his decision to not stabilize her war righteous since he heard her say ""Yes"" to that queen question.   
The party except him wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt and the little dullahan player pointed out that during the whole session they had so many hint about her being charmed and that the ""Yes"" was taken into account by her BG since even if she knew to be under the effect of a spell she still was happy to be loved by someone after so many years of de-humanizing slavery, but that doesnt mean she didnt want to kill the queen for her actions.

Someone isn't happy by how everything played out, even the DM is quite uncertain to how to proceed this point forward.

What's your take on this whole story? About the Cleric actions, the DM ruling and so on?

Thanks again for any advice, tips and hints you might give and for helping in general with all the situation. I'll answer any question you might have and I wish you a nice week, have fun \^\^",dnd

Lore:

The son of a Blacksmith Lobo was born and raised in a town near the citadel. He'd often day dream about being a knight and be able fight using a blade and nor just make them but he knew that his fate was tethered to his Ancestry.

Then one day the mages of the Citadel announced that they'd be conducting a public demonstration of their new magical mechanism 
the Temporal Hastener which they claimed would usher us into the future of spellcasting. 
(Dunomancy) the demonstration would be on his 17th birthday 

After hours of begging he convinced his mother and Father to leave the shop and watch the spectacle in the city with him, after all he needed a little excitement after; Shoveling Coal, and beating metal with more metal for 12 hours a day.

At the Demonstration the Mages mentioned several times over that it that it was perfectly safe before they turned a large lever to start the contraption. it was a wonderous sight all colors of the rainbow whirling inside the Copper chamber. Then the bright colors became a static-like Gray and Black

Lobo had shoved his way to to the front to get a better look including politely pushing a small girl out of his way as he looked on in wonder for only an instant before something was wrong the mages began to panic when one yelled 
""It's completely destabalized! The cooling mechanism has melted through! Meltdown Imminent!"" 
the audience watched in horror and panic as the mages attampted to cast shielding magics on themselves. then the machine blew. Lobo threw himself in front of the  young girl and his father that was reaching out to grab him. The machine exploded in a blinding flash

When Lobo awoke he was disoriented and alone his body would phase in and out of existence which was incredibly painful. 
The Mages informed him that he and the young girl were the only Survivors of the terrible accident and that he has contracted a Temporal sickness that they have no hope of understanding let alone curing at this time and that he would be bound to a hospice forever.

cutting the mage off a grizzled knight stepped into the room. He introduced himself as Sir Rodrick Blackstone, and informed Lobo that the young girl he saved was his niece and that he was incredibly grateful for his sacrifice but that he wasn't dead and  had full intent of taking Lobo as his Squire in order to watch over him if he was willing.

Lobo agreed and he worked hard and became an amazing fighter Traveling with Sir Rodrick but would continue to have issues with his sickness getting worse whenever he entered a state of heightened emotion, prompting him to adopt a stoic and detached demeanor which not only made him an amazing fighter but helped keep his sickness at bay for a time at the cost of his outgoing personality



After three years and many successful campaigns Sir Rodrick announced that he'd reitire that same year and that Lobo should go off on a new adventure away from the smell of old people as the knight, no, his father now winked at him while lapping
his Pale Ale. Lobo would remain stoic but inside he felt his emotions coming to a boil.

later that night Lobo had an anxiety attack causing him great pain due to his sickness. He was able to calm himself telling himself he'd visit all the time as he walked down stairs for a bale of water.

It was then that a window broke. Lobo dashed to a nearby table to grab a hidden knife he watched as 6 men held down the man that treated him as a son

the men pulled him up with a knife to his throat and said ""The Secret dies with you old man, The Black Fang send their regards"" 

Now! Lobo thought, he leapt out from behind the table 

""A perfectly placed strike to the nape of the neck and through the brain should be the easiest way"", he thought ""I'm calm I can do this."" But he wasn't calm he was enraged and Terrified
In mid air his body convulsed and Fizzled in and out of time he fell to the floor and was quickly aprehended by 2 of the assailants 

the men made him watch as they put the knife to his father's throat 

and yelled ""your next brat""(yes they spoke so badly that I'm not putting the apostrophe)

Sir Blackstone uttered the Words ""I love you son""

Lobo closed his eyes let out a wild yell of Agony as time and space began to warp around him.
A portal was spawned taking him and the two men holding him to another place, empty cloudy and dark with primordial energy sparking and flashing all around in storms the terrain warped and twisted by primordial powers.

Lobo grabbed one of the men and slit his throat before kicking him off the cliff to turn around and stab the other who was still stuned, prone on the ground in the heart. but then then Lobo heard the man he had kicked off the cliff plead for his life once more. He turned around and saw the man with a look of terror on his face as his throat slit open and an invisible force pushed him off the cliff once more. Lobo figured He had gotten stuck in a wierd time loop.

Lobo would soon after realize that he had been transported to the Temporal plane or the plane of time. In this place he no longer felt the sympthoms of his affliction he saw this as an opportunity to get stronger for the time when he'd make his return and get revenge. He got to work right away and quickly learned to harness the Temporal fragments he residualy left behind while moving through space, manifesting them as his Echoes.

Sometimes when Spells involving space and time including summoning and Banishing spells as well as Dunomancy are cast an Echo is also cast into the Temporal Plane, as well as the Native Eldritch monsters making this plane an extremely dangerous place.

In this Darkness Lobo became a Survivalist the Apex predator hunting anything that dared to step into his domain from Beasts to Warriors, Lobo honed his skills tracking and hunting his with deadly efficiency using the various temporal anomalies to his advantage.

Eventually a portal would open that allowed Lobo to return to the prime material plane. 

Upon his return he'd go to his home and take his adoptive Father's armor and Halberd vowing to find the secret he was killed over and reveal it to the world


he is currently

Working as a sell sword to gather resources and information to take down the Black Fang




TLDR: 

He was in a Flash-Esque Dunomancy experiment that turned him into tracer without her Accelerator. (Explaining his Echo Knight Sub-Class)

Then his adoptive father who is also a knight that trains him gets shanked for knowing a secret and then he gets mad so he transports himself and 2 dudes to the Temporal Plane(Time Plane) he then proceeds to merc them and hunt Echoes(Kinda the Time Shadow of spells  that happens sometimes Including but not limited to Summoning, Banishing, Familiars etc. ao crazy monsters) in this dark foreign plane (3 Levels of Ranger until gloomstalker) then a portal opens and now he's a badass ready to fuck shit up as a Sell sword

oh and he's stoic and quiet because he has a condition but he won't tell you that so you'll probably be a jerk to him lol",dnd

[The Ritual of Archlichdom by u\/Ardagaur](https://preview.redd.it/y7otb6bb8cu51.jpg?width=2100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8e1510c4ecbd1419b2bf922709275e61733bf55)

* The ritual to become an Archlich is nearly identical to that of a Lich. The only major changes are the cost of the phylactery and potion ingredients: an evil Lich's phylactery would cost 1,500gp x level (17+) since it's a variation of the Imprisonment Spell, while the original potion ingredients for an evil Lich can be found within the Encycopedia Magica vol.3 (2e).
* Archliches can be of Good or Neutral alignment and serve to protect a certain cause, loved being, or place. Unlike evil Liches who sacrifice others for their immortality, the Archlich sacrifices it's own soul and swears an oath. Essentially Archliches function as arcane paladins; the magic of their oath binds them to an eternity of service and prevents their phylactery from requiring souls and therefore prevents a Archlich's eventual decay into Demilichdom. An evil lich would require souls every century in order to stave off degeneration into Demilichdom. In my opinion, unlike an evil lich, an Archlich whose phylactery is destroyed means that their undead body and soul are destroyed just as if their soul was consumed by an evil Lich's phylactery. Failure to uphold their oath will cause them to slowly turn into evil Liches therefore meaning they would need to consume souls.
* In 5e the process to become a lich requires the spellcaster to be able to cast 9th level Wizard spells. It takes 10 days to construct the phylactery and 3 days to concoct the potion of transformation. Out of homage to the original Archlich from Lost Ships and the apparent rarity of Archliches, I decided to make an Archlich's phylactery cost as much as a legendary magic item.

259,Few Questions For A Complete Newbie!,1,jf0wzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/jf0wzg/few_questions_for_a_complete_newbie/,11,1603263958.0,"Hey guys,

I'd like to apologise in advance in case these are totally stupid questions. I've just started playing the DnD starter set, as my kids want to play so I bought the set and I've volunteered as the DM. My wife is playing along with my two kids to have a party of 3. 

&#x200B;

It's taken a bit to get used too, and I'm confused on a lot of things. I'm trying to keep it smooth, but atm I am just so clunky.

&#x200B;

So I had a few questions in particular to the story we were playing (For those familiar to the starter event, the party of 3 have just found the entrance to Cragmaw after following the Gobin Trail).  


So the questions that arose -

  
a) My son was playing the Wizard, and cast his spells (Burning Hands and Sleep). Despite looking in the rule book, I couldn't find any information on 'to hit' rolls. Do these spells auto hit and its just a case of its not a roll for the mage to hit, but a roll for the creature to save. Or is there a to hit roll, a save roll and then a damage roll. I honestly wasn't sure.

b) That same Mage got reduced to 0HP during the first encounter. My other son, the Cleric, decided to heal him. I let this go. Can you heal someone on 0HP? Are they just classed as unconscious?  What happens if he fails his death roll next turn.

c) After said battle, my youngest son on 4hp decided to 'short rest'. Sure. I'm wondering how often can this be done. Is there any consequence to basically repeatedly doing it to regain HP? I saw you can only do 1 long rest per 24hrs, but what about short rest?  And is there any consequence storywise for resting. I made up a bit about losing track of the goblins if they waited too long etc.

d) If someone has advantage (i think at my discretion), do I just give them 2xD20 instead of the usual 1?

e) Can a rogue sneak attack during combat where she's already been noticed, if she can position herself behind a monster whos already in face to face combat with another party member for example? And what are the rules for sneak attack.

I've got a ton more, but I honestly don't want to spam. I'll just leave these here, and if anyone knows any answers please just reply with etc c) xxxxx so I know.

  
Thanks in advance,",dnd
260,Red Mage from Final Fantasy in 5e?,1,jf0w39,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/jf0w39/red_mage_from_final_fantasy_in_5e/,21,1603263879.0,"So, I was thinking of at one point playing a character inspired by the famous class from Final Fantasy: the Red Mage, but I'm not quite sure on how to handle it best gameplay-wise in this edition. I'll go over what I was mainly thinking.

In Final Fantasy, Red Mages are a sort of Jack-of-all-Trades class, specialising in both Black Magic (offensive elemental magic) and White Magic (healing and buffing magic), though lacking the strongest spells of both, as well as being a competent physical attacker. From Final Fantasy V onwards, it's been customary for the Red Mage to have the ability ""Dualcast"", allowing them to cast two low-level spells at once.

Basically, what I'm looking for out of a Red Mage build is:

* Use of both melee weapons/armour and magic
* Preferably using INT as the spell modifier
* Acts as a somewhat supportive role in the party
* Access to some healing (doesn't have to be a lot)
* *Maybe* something like what I descibed Dualcast to be like (you can ingnore this one if you want)

Thanks in advance.",dnd

I tend to think 5e overall did a good job attaching their archetypes to classes where it made sense, but I still really wish, occasionally, for something like prestige classes. I was watching a video on Eilistraee, and I caught myself wishing I could could play an Eilistraeean Cleric, or a Bard who wosrhips Her, who could bladesing. Unfortunately, that means playing a Wizard, and then leveling up to their archetype; weird for me to say shame and Wizard in same moment, but here it is. Sort of reminded me of the time I sort of wanted to play a Rogue who had the benefits of the Diviner.

Do you ever wish some of the archetypes were less rooted to one class, or more easily substituted to another? I know it's easy enough to give an NPC whatever, but so many of my neat NPCs come about because of my perpetual-DMitus, and the character ideas I'd love to play, if I could just have the chance.

I am planning to run my first campaign for my group. I did a few One-Shot here and there and was always excited to experiment with all the classes.

A player wants to create a Rune Knight (UA) and asked if he could change the Rune Magic DC:

Rune Options
Here are rune options for the Rune Magic feature. They are all magical effects.

If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune Magic save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

Above the original. Now he wants to change the INT modifier to A WIS modifier. 

Would that be doable? I don‘t want a broken op PC in the game. I think it would do little harm, but I‘m not sure about the consequences.

A sorcerer with a charlatan background. She is walking from town to town pretending to be a Cleric. She chooses religion based on who is she speaking with. She has got around 10 holy symbols on herself. She is wearing a scarf to veil (pun intended) her red hair.   
She is chaotic neutral. She has some weird quirks based on redhead superstitions. For example, she likes to spook sailors by speaking to them before boarding the revealing her hair then leaving. :D

So, what happens when there is a skill check that the player can take, but it would for sure be impossible. Now I’m not talking about a player saying something like “I want to lift this mountain” and they roll a NAT 20, fist off I as a DM would rule that to be a possible feat and also my players aren’t that ridiculous. However, there are more reasonable things that the player would logically be allowed to roll for. 

For example, I have an upcoming session and there will be two NPCs. They both served in a war together and are loyal to each other. One of the NPCs is a mayor of sorts of a small town, the other is his old war buddy who is sort of the sheriff. 

Now, part of the pay is in jail, the other half is helping with the investigation. So the Sheriff is at the jail questioning the two party members in custody. If one of the party members were to try and persuade the sheriff to let them go, I would (in all good faith as a DM) allow the I roll for it. Obviously in real life the sheriff would never let the party members go, but this is not real life.

To my point, what happens if there is a skill check that logically wouldn’t happen, like them rolling a NAT 20 to persuade the sheriff to let them go, or something of the sort. Does anyone have any tips on how to get through that situation but still keep a good flow with the game and not just saying “no, you can’t do that”",dnd

Okay, so I love 5e. It's really well balanced in terms of possibilities and of options for what and how one wants to play. It's relatively simple (especially compared to other D&D versions) and it's accessible to the masses. BUT. Its spellcasting is a mess. Every class has a different way to gain and use spells and don't get me started on the nonsensical components of spells!

So here's what I propose. I've used this to ""mod"" 5e for my group in the past (and I don't anymore because it requires too much modding and tweaking of 5e) and it's pretty balanced in combat and gives more creative and narrative freedom/options/possibilities.

Basically, spell slots are arranged in a triangle (see attached image). 9 First level spells, 8 Second level spell and so on, up to 1 Ninth level spell. The triangle shape of arranging dots or rather circles is to have a visual, easy to track support. Kind of like Death Saves, in how they would look; but probably bigger circles. When you gain access to a new spell level, you gain access to one more spell of every level below it. For instance, when you get access to Third level spells, you have, in total, 1 Third level spell, 2 Second level spells and 3 First level spells. Visually, this means you have access to a small triangle of the whole spell triangle.

You gain access to a certain spell level when your character reaches twice that level; i.e., you gain access to Second level spells at PC level 4, and Ninth level spells at PC level 18. No matter your class, you ""unlock"" spell levels at the appropriate character levels — this is on purpose, we'll get to it. Note that multiclassing is not affected (not really) in this way. you *can* cast Fourth level spells if, for exemple, you have a Rogue-Cleric of total PC level 9 with 4 levels in Rogue and 5 in Cleric; but this character only *knows* Second-level cleric spells. They can still cast those spells at higher levels, with the usual bonuses, if applicable.

This makes it so any one character has more spell slots (than they would in the current 5e system) but I don't think that's a bad thing. It would emphasize magic for the characters using it and devalue their martial weapons. A mage shouldn't care about vulgar swords when they can make a more elegant spectral sword to fight with.

Now, about components and prepared spells... I hate them. Both of them. The whole idea seems half-baked, to me. In my mind — **I will remind you, kind reader, that this is only** ***my*** **proposed version of a possible way that** ***I*** **like to better deal with magic in D\&D; it is most definitely wrong and broken, I'm not a game designer, just a nerd who likes to tweak the rules of the game to better suit my taste** (hence why I would suggest using this or a similar concept in a 6^(th) edition of D&D) — in my mind, only a few classes should have to deal with materials and only a few others with the verbal aspects of spells. Plus, in the current system, foci just remove the need for any of that and are (generally) too easy to get a hold of to be meaningful. And preparing spells only makes sense if you have *stuff* to prepare (material components). Therefore, I would remove the concept of prepared spells completely and only *add* *it back in* for certain classes, such as artificers and druids and possibly a few high-level or really powerfull spells, i.e. Resurrection and the like. Verbal components would only afflict wizards and clerics (maybe palladins and warlocks too) but all spells would still require some movement, so physical restraints would still stop spellcasting. This means, of course, that when your character reaches a certain class level and gains access to new spells, they have *access* to any and all the spells of their class from that level and below, if they choose to *learn* them. There would be a class-dictated limit to the number of spells per level one can learn. For instance, let's take our Rogue-Cleric from earlier. They could learn any Second-level spell from the cleric spellcasting list and always be able to cast it, if they have the slot available for it, of course. No morning preparations nonsense.

Regarding warlocks and rangers. Rangers should be drastically modified, I think everyone agrees on that. So let's assume that a 6e ranger does not use spells but rather knows how make some potions and uses fighter maneuvers — topic for another day. Warlocks, in their current state, have a certain number of spell slots all considered to be the same level. That is unique and this system preserves that aspect. Currently, however, a warlock's spellcasting level caps at Fifth level spells. In this proposed system, at level 18, a warlock would end up having access to 45 Fifth level spell slots, which is ridiculous; so warlocks would be restricted in some way. My thought is they should get ""worn out"" after using four spell slots (their current max spell slots) and need a short rest before casting more. A long rest would refresh all expended spell slots.

This post is already too long, but I have many more ideas and things to say about this system — including how non-spellcasting classes can use the circles for other purposes — so I am going to respond to any questions.

Thank you for reading this long.

A Couple of months back my friends and I started a new Dungeons and Dragons campaign in a litrpg setting. We decided to record it and throw it up on YouTube in case anyone was interested in following our little adventure.

I finally got around to uploading them and published episode 1 today. I have 5 more recorded and ready to go, but I want get on a regular release schedule of once a week. (every Wednesday at 10am CST, episode 2 is set to be released on 10/28)

The recording quality isn't great, we are working on it and are (slowly) getting better.

The setting takes place in the year 2085. Two of the major advances to the worlds technology is that a true AI has been developed, and there is now a world government sponsored Afterlife program.

The Afterlife program is where people have ""backup"" technology installed in their bodies and, upon death, are digitally uploaded to a specific Afterlife iteration. How good of an afterlife they get depends on their actions and behavior from before they died.

Our four protagonists start episode one coming to in a particular Afterlife iteration with no memory of anything that happened before that point. Some of them realize they are in afterlife, some of them are in denial, but they definitely have an interesting introduction to the world!

We are calling this podcast the ""Dead Protagonist Society"" and if you decide to give it a listen/watch, I hope you enjoy it!

Our group has been playing every-other week for over two years now and when the pandemic hit we moved from in-person to online sessions. Although I miss getting together on a Sunday afternoon for a D&D potluck and look forward to the days when we can roll dice in person, I truly value the connection and social interaction that we have been able to maintain.

Unfortunately, a member of my D&D group was hospitalized last week. He learned that he needed a heart valve replaced due to a bacterial infection. After a few days, he was released from the hospital with meds and a plan for surgery after the infection had cleared up.

He was feeling up to it, and we were all looking forward to playing, so we held our Sunday session as planned. Near the end of the session, he went offline and we thought his connection had dropped. We found out that he had a stroke and was rushed to the hospital.

He's the sole income in his family and will be without income while he is on FMLA (along with a pile of medical bills). His wife setup a GoFundMe (https://gf.me/u/y4zhkq) and our group wanted to support him by sharing it with as large an audience as possible. If you are inclined and able to help, it would mean a lot.

I have been playing D&D for about 18 years.  I have been the DM since the beginning, and probably 90% of the time.  I had no idea when I drew this little map, just how much was going to actually take place in this world I was starting.  It has been a long and wonderful adventure with villains rising and falling, heroic deeds done, and forgotten.

Anyways, I thought it would be fun to do a little look back at where it started, and where it currently is.  This is Gelspare, the main continent of my world (there are 4 others).  This is where most of the stuff takes place, and it has been a treat finally giving it the update it deserves.

I know this is kind of a weird question, so sorry if it does not belong here.  
I'm looking into ""playing"" to some sort of automated game.  
I'm looking for a campaign where characters, story (and its paths) are all defined.

In this campaign, the ""Game Master"" would only read the story. While reading the story, there are decisions to be made, where the players can choose between (for example) action A, B or C. And then throw some dice. Then the story would continue through a path depending on what happened throwing the dice.

Basically, playing something like a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose\_Your\_Own\_Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) but with DnD vibes, I guess.

A player of mine is wanting to do a draconic bloodline (copper) sorcerer bloodline sorcerer, but we both agree that the acid-based spells available are sorely lacking. I had an idea to convert some of the more traditional fire-based spells into acid damage via homebrew, slightly reducing damage because acid is a ""better"" damage type. Here are some examples:

* Acid Spray (Burning hands) deals 3d4 acid damage in a 15-foot cone
* Caustic Orbs (Scorching ray) deals 2d4 acid damage per ray
* Caustic Burst (Fireball) deals 10d4 acid damage in a 20-foot sphere

351,5e - Wilderness Exploration,1,jevkx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/jevkx6/5e_wilderness_exploration/,21,1603247581.0,"Of the three stated pillars of 5e, combat, interaction and exploration, the latter surely  gets the least attention. I have had many discussions with my players, and other GM's about travel and exploration, and while most people I have spoken to agree that travel and exploration could be an interesting and integral part of any story, the rules are not sufficient to really make the process exciting, or even interesting. This includes even the [Unearthed Arcana: Into the Wild](https://media.wizards.com/2018/dnd/downloads/UA_IntoTheWild.pdf) rules expansion and things like The Angry GM's [Getting There is Half the Fun](https://theangrygm.com/getting-there-is-half-the-fun/) discussion. Both of these things definitely add a valuable piece to the conversation, but there's still something missing when it comes to exploring the untamed wilderness that so often permeates many campaigns.

I am working on developing some true exploration rules for my game, and want to share them with the community. Also, if anyone has any suggestions for resources I can reference in the process, or if there is a resource out there already that I am simply duplicating, please point me in that direction.

So with that out of the way, let's get into what I've been working on. I have been a police officer for almost a decade now. I have done a fair amount of training when it comes to searching, and have a reasonable amount of experience as well. I grew up in the hills of the Ozarks in southern Missouri, and  have experience hunting and tracking in the wild. That all is to say, I do have some direct knowledge of the topic, and have some ideas on how we could potentially make the process more engaging and exciting for players. That is the goal, of course, to take an aspect of the game that many consider boring and tedious, and that many GM's just hand wave and narrate, and turn it into something meaningful and fun with which players can interact.

The intention here is to build upon the previously established rules, which are mostly intended to facilitate a party getting from one place to another and what happens to them while en route, and create a system for systematically and intentionally searching an area. This sounds easy enough in theory, but anyone who has shot a deer and had it run off on them can attest to the difficulty of tracking something through overgrown wilderness. Many of my friends have given up entirely on just that scenario. That's with a fresh hit and a reasonable trail to follow, especially by D&D standards. The other side of this scenario is searching for a missing person. Inevitably every year there is a story of someone getting lost in the mountains or some other national park. Park Rangers are especially familiar with search methodology for this reason.

To apply this to D&D, the first step is developing a solid baseline to work from. For searching a wilderness area, I found this guide to [Sar Field Search Methods](https://kyem.ky.gov/Who%20We%20Are/Documents/SAR%20Field%20Search%20Methods.pdf) distributed by the Kentucky government most useful. It contains a good discussion of basic terminology like ""Probability of Detection"", along with a basic discussion of seven search methods, of which the Bastard Search, Hasty Search and Grid Search are most useful to my ideas. It is all the more useful because it accomplishes all this in under 8 pages that can be read in less than 10 minutes.  The useful starting point found here is the time required to thoroughly search a square mile of wilderness, 924 man hours. A little basic math turns this into 2772 8-hour days, the standard ""work day"" in 5e, or approximately seven and a half years for a single person to thoroughly search a square mile using a grid search method. Sounds super fun for a player, right? 

I have more to add, but this seems like a good place to pause for now, and see if anyone has any other thoughts on the matter before I go any further. Or maybe someone can share a method that makes further discussion unnecessary.

A two years pass, and I am married still in college. I spent those two years designing my ultimate world. I had 167k words written about it, 300+ plot points/side quests/dungeons, religious diversity. I ran several one shots for a group, and was starting to get some confidence in DMing. 

So, my husband DMs. He had a group of other DMs that he plays with, and they trade off DMing every so often. I had started playing with them, and they were a fun group of people. 

Well, my turn to DM came around, and I was really nervous. They all promised that they would help me with rules and running a long campaign, and that they would go easy on me. 

So starts 4 months of biweekly sessions. (35 sessions summaries in my notebook) that averaged about 4 hours each.  These DMs that were players were some of the biggest min/maxing, meta gaming, rule and plot stickler, murder hobos that have ever played D&D. 

They claimed to love my DMing, which I had a lot of home-brew magic stuff in, but argued with me constantly on every little thing. They pushed and picked at every detail, trying to see how far they could go. My husband was the worst of them, trying to walk all over me. 

Then, after every single session, they would give me a twenty minute lecture about what I needed to do better on. If it was constructive, it would be one thing, but it was not. It was 'that sucked.' or 'you shouldn't do that again.' and, my favorite, 'why wasn't there any plot hooks?' (They killed every plot hook character I presented them. **All 26 of them**. Including an innocent 7 year old girl running through the woods screaming help.)

After that, I had enough and said that I didn't want to DM anymore. They got all offended that I was ditching them in the middle of the story. I told them that DMing was making me miserable and that I didn't want to play D&D with them anymore.

""As Plaintiff-Creators subsequently learned, Defendant’s arbitrary decision to terminate the License Agreement — and thereby the book publishing contract — was based on events that had nothing to do with either the Work or Plaintiff-Creators. In fact, at nearly the exact point in time of the termination, Defendant was embroiled in a series of embarrassing public disputes whereby its non-Dragonlance publications were excoriated for racism and sexism. Moreover, the company itself was vilified by well-publicized allegations of misogyny and racist hiring and employment practices by and with respect to artists and employees unrelated to Dragonlance.""

It seems that near-constant witch hunts fueled by identity politics (example, ""orcs are racist"") from a vocal online minority have left their impression on WotC and made them jumpy. Likely, one of the sensitivity readers that were recently hired to placate the controversies had a look at the first book of the planned trilogy and made a fuss.

One of my players has already decided to leave the campaign.

I have been DMing for about 6 to 7 months now for a group of 6 players. We play remote from three locations (5-1-1), which has made it difficult for the isolated player to get fully integrated to the RP phases of the campaign.

So, around 4 or 5 seasons ago, my players concluded the first ""arc"" of the campaign after defeating a boss they had been chasing for quite some time. It was an epic battle and it was a lot of fun. The issue is how the campaign has evolved in the recent sessions, and I can't help but feel, as the DM, it is my fault and I should find a way of addressing it.

One or two sessions before the battle, I introduced an additional quest for the party, consisting in finding who the boss they fought was working for. Naturally, after defeating the boss, this was the priority quest for the party. All the sessions since have been spent with the party investigating multiple leads and discussing their next move. They are also currently in a big town which limits the opportunities of introducing random fights to improve the pacing of the sessions.

The party has not expressed boredom to me, but I have the feeling I am failing them as a DM - especially the isolated player, who has decided to quit the campaign.

What I would like to do is try to expedite this boring story arc and move to more entertaining other quests for the party - and make them leave the city as fast as possible. At the same time, I do not want to railroad the players. So far it seems like they have been enjoying this investigation process and they are still actively discussing during every session - which is great to witness as the DM. I want to find an organic way to hasten the process without it feeling too much like a ""deus ex machina"".

Any advice? I apologise in advance, I'm not sure I am phrasing everything in a clear way. Basically I have a group of players that are stuck in a boring story arc and it cost me one of the players. I want to find a way to get them out of that boring arc so we can move on to more exciting things, but find a way of doing it without it feeling forced.

371,IMMERINI: An initiative system for the boldest of DMs and players,0,jetoh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/jetoh8/immerini_an_initiative_system_for_the_boldest_of/,24,1603242091.0,"This system does away with rolling ANY dice for initiative. It's also not some populist solution to 5e's  ini system. It will take a specific kind of DM and a specific group of players. Those who value immersion and narrative over turns and technicalities will likely find this interesting. But I am quite sure for a lot of you, for one reason or another, this just won't be your jam.

In fact, if your first inkling is to respond why you DON'T like it, then it's just not for you, and that's okay, but this post is more for those who are naturally curious and are willing to cast aside preconceived notions or the comfort of rule sets.

I am positive there are other kindred spirits out there who will want to try this and if they commit to it, they fall in love with it.

IMMERINI: Stands for immersive initiative. The story and actions of players decide combat order. This is not a linear system with rules for you or the group to learn. IMMERINI is completely dependent on the DM's ability to think quickly and critically. It's not easy sometimes, but after trying EVERY DAMN SYSTEM OUT THERE, this one feels the most immersive and organic.

\+++FOR DMs++++

You decide combat order by just narratively flowing into combat. You'll be asking a version of ""What do you do?"" a lot, and who you ask and when you ask will feel smoother over time. You'll be putting the group in an order that you feel makes the most sense in that moment. You are the DM, player's don't really question  stuff like ""that cliff is 50 feet high"" or ""She cradles the cat like a child and begins to sob"". So if you've done a good job setting the scene, they're not likely to stop the flow of the game to question why you picked one character over another. 

The round 1 order you put them in can be tweaked, depending on events, but it's never some wholesale rearrangement. Also since players never see an enemies roll (you can still roll a d20 if you really want for them) they have a harder time predicting when that enemy will attack. You can give them narrative cues like...

(I will use classes vice names for these examples)

DM: ""As your party enters the dark cavern with the prisoners you freed, you all quickly hear screams of horror. You look up and see what the prisoners have seen, a massive, three-armed abomination roars and charges out of the shadows and towards you.

""Wizard, The 20 foot tall amalgam of nightmares lurches back ready to slam it's massive, blobby fist onto your skull."" (The player now understands they have little time to act without the need of an actual timer. If they don't act in a reasonable time, then have the monster attack and force them to react .If they ""do blow it"" on their turn, best believe they'll be plenty motivated when you call on them again. Redemption is a powerful narrative tool.

Why did you pick the wizard first? because it makes the most sense in the moment. Maybe the Wiz doesn't have dark vision or the player was careless with how far they moved their token. Maybe your players will grill you as to why you picked the wiz first, those type of questions will subside over time because...

ACTIONS=CONSEQUENCES and DANGER IS IMMINENT

Another player (Drow Arcane Trickster) could chime in and say, ""Can I shoot an arrow at it?"" or ""Would casting dancing lights maybe distract it?"" You  reward that quick thinking... ""You can tell by the mass of a creature that a regular arrow might not do much, but dancing lights could buy your companion enough time to move and cast a spell.""

Once players forego the constraints of rolling ini and knowing the turn order ahead of time, you will get really intuitive questions like the real world examples above.

DAT: Okay, I cast dancing lights and try to sneak around the monster.

DM: The monster turns it's head to avoid the bright lights. It buys wizard enough time to cast a spell and likely move to safety.

WIZ: I'll cast scorching ray! Can I move back to here behind the barbarian?

DM: Okay Wizard go ahead and roll. If the rays hit you can get out of harms way. If they miss, you might be in trouble.

Drow, the bright lights coupled with streak of flame make it easy for you to sneak around behind the monster you can roll stealth with advantage. \[other members\] what would you all like to do?

Whoever chimes in next can go next. Maybe they all hesitate giving the monster a chance to slam the ground with disadvantage.

IMMERINI is simple in form, but nuanced in application.

You can have the monster attack whenever it makes sense for the narrative. Maybe the group does a good job CCing it into the ground and it can barely act, maybe they're all a bit slow to decide giving the monster another attack, thereby increasing the risk of danger, thereby ratcheting up the drama. Since the players really don't know what will happen next, they all stay on edge and are much more focused (again, for a lot of DMs and players, this just own't be their jam).

EX 2: many mobs

DM: The ambient red chamber must be at least 80 feet high. Two long barbed chains dangle from the darkness above. They connect to two medium size cages hang 30 feet off the ground. A horde of imps all cackle as they take turns torturing the two prisoners. One looks like a young half-orc, the other you recognize. It's your (sensei, companion, mother, etc). There must be at least a dozen imps. They haven't noticed your party yet. if you all keep your voices low and stay where you are, you can likely plan an ambush...

Now just wait... *Somebody* will say *something*. Then just riff off of that.

maybe they ask what weapons the imps have.

Maybe one of them talks too loudly...boom. You can have a natural consequence to that action right then. You don't have to wait for the imps turn (because they never rolled ini).

Maybe they take too long and the prisoners go unconscious from the pain...(more drama!)

ADVICE: With lots of mobs, I like to bunch them into groups of 2-4. so for this encounter, I may have it planned that they attack in three waves of four (there are 12 total). But I'll likely wait and see what actions the players are taking.

Again, IMMERINI is not for DMs who already struggle with tracking turns. But, if you already hide all your rolls and like to play it fast and loose, and are able to think on your toes,  then these type of encounters will rarely, if ever, go south on you.

Also, if your players aren't being proactive, just call on them based on location, dex mod, narrative flow, etc., or just let the monsters take more actions (within reason). Players will realize they HAVE to act or else things will end badly for them. This deliberate progression of the narrative will force them to dive in. And it does a better job simulating what life and death combat is like. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This system is not without it's quirks. And yes, as you begin implementing this, you will get yourself in sticky moments, but even when things might feel a bit clunky or awkward, IMMERINI is perpetually helping develop your sweet, sweet DM skills (and even life skills!).

If you value narrative and immersion, drama and tension, then the rewards of IMMERINI for both players and DMs will far outweigh the awkwardness.

And if you hate this and it isn't your jam, that's okay. You're still a gorgeous human being, and I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.

If anyone wants some more examples or advice, please let me know. I am lucky enough to get paid to DM, and run games four times a week. I will gladly share more actual examples of IMMERINI at work.

I wanted to make a Modern Day Magician in a Fantasy Magic Setting. Of course, he still has fantasy elements to him, but he knows no magic, nor will he ever. He is just a magician.

I made him a variant human so I could get the “Observant” Feat, went Charlatan so I got proficiency in Sleight of Hand and Deception for free, Used Variant Human To Increase Dex And Charisma, went with expertise in Deception and Sleight of Hand so now I get double proficiency bonus on those skills, and even went Rogue so I am able to really use my Dex to its full advantage!

**Heres what i got from brainstorming today.**

**World**

-Somehow modern world

-First of lots of magic and monsters
Most people have a simple life some gonaut adventuring just like in dnd

-No internet, no satelites, no complex devices

-Phones are rare and only work internal in a city. sometimes only to the next city if its close. A stone of Sending would do better

-Cites aren't close. There are a few towns between them but population in this campaign is so low you could consider it postapocalyptic 

-Radios are rare in commercial use but used by goverment in public places mostly in metroplises

-Continent has some cities and towns 
And a few metropolises

-different cultures

-radio stations exist in few. Sometimes fought over 

-commercial food Packaging and products exist like in naruto or in the 18th hundred but no fast food. 

-Architecture depends on the city but is medieval in general. Brick walls and windows 

-Bookprint exists 

-No steampunk. Maybe sometimes

-Have you read 4 cut hero?

-wide variety of races even candy people could exist here as subrace of oozes

-some mascots or fictional peoples popularity could result in them existing as tulpa in the campaigm world. Tulpa are entities created through the belief of a collective mind. Kinda like how our rogue became a goddess because she collected  
Acolytes and fans.


**things in my campaign**

Todays brainstorming


-Sacrecrow druid who helps farmer keep crop safe

farmer donates seed to druid 
-Sirens with venom sac breasts who want shiny stuff

-Warforged dungeon (portal) 

Hero forge. Order magic custom bioengineered hero clone (slavery) 

-various integration programs funded by government or tribes like goblin mail wife or devil exchange program

-Unicorn horn and herb gathering(quest) 

- elf race variant based on loyalty and knighthood (they carry a crystal imbeded im their chest its their symbolic heart)

All the work around the dead started to corrupt her and for most of our champaign, she became more and more egoistic and less sympathetic for other people lives. 
In our last session she found out she can't turn her brother into a Lich, and she found a powerful wizard friend how can cure her brother if she will bring him the man how cursed him(he is actually a dragon).

I'm already running through a list of changes and am pretty set on alterations I want to make but wanted some feedback on one course I was toying with.

Instead of Kolyan Indirovich being dead prior to the start of the campaign I was thinking of having him alive when the PCs arrive, that he's in his panic over Ireena but believes the PCs will be able to sort out the problems and begins to grow hopeful now that they're here.

The additional change, inspired heavily by Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing, was to have the Brides of Strahd arrive in town with retainers to both show the PCs a threat of force from Strahd, to have Kolyan killed by one of the brides, and give the PCs their first taste of conflict with the Master of Barovia as I completely intend for Strahd to arrive after Kolyan's death to nobly call off the assault and chide his minions as if he had not ordered them to this.

I've never run CoS before, I felt this change would be a good, immediate hook of trying to upsell Strahd's minions, to show how brutal he is about crushing hope (outside of what's allowed in Vallaki), and make Strahd out to be as disingenuous as possible (as obviously no native Barovian is going to believe he didn't give that order, but... maybe a seed of doubt about the monster.).

There is even a new rule that allows NPCs to hold both their movement AND attack action, but get this... when I get within 10 ft to make my attack they move five feet to make their attack and SO that doesn't trigger an opportunity attack since they are already within 10ft 🤷‍♂️ yes holding your movement and attack action somehow doesn't trigger a Sentinel opportunity attack...

And when I'm attacking from 10ft away baddies will ignore me and attack allies even if I hit harder (DM says their strategy is to take out the weakest players first). But if I move within 5 ft suddenly the big baddie only attacks me, once again preventing a Sentinel opportunity attack...

So given that I get to use the Sentinel feature once in awhile, I'm thinking about dropping it and picking up an ASI to boost strength and Con each from 17 to 18 

 Maybe I'll take GWM later?

Thoughts?

I was a total stranger to all these players except my close friend who got me an invite to the table, before the game even started this guy was kinda mean to me when I made a joke on the group discord (other people did find it funny and it wasnt offensive/dark) and when I mentioned in passing I'd be doing a character voice he was explicitly mean saying it was ""stupid"". (Character voice is southern American ""cowboy"" as the character is based off western films - it's not perfect but im actually decent at accents so its not awful)

Over time I became friendly with all the other players, especially the DM and one other who I had some great RP moments with that lead to irl conversation. But he's remained staunchly standoffish both in game and out, only responding negatively to my jokes/general questions and messages, but positively to everyone else. In game I asked a question about an NPC we were talking to and he said semi slyly ""must be because you were concentrating on your character voice"". 

Im not daft, i know what comes out on the surface is the tip of the iceberg and as he knows all the others personally I've no doubt im getting badmouthed, which is stupid because we're all adults in our 20s and 30s and not preteen schoolgirls. Because im not someone to let shitty behaviour go unchallenged this has brought conflict and stressing me out, hence I'm wondering: when should I let it go and just exit the game?

414,The age old Limb Question,1,jeq5qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/jeq5qy/the_age_old_limb_question/,6,1603231607.0,"Hi folks,
So, I had a situation happen to me as a player that puzzles me a lot. So I figured sharing it with you all and see what is the general thoughts. 

We are playing a DnD Ebbron 5e game. I am playing a mark of storm half-elf storm sorcerer in a party of six. All of us are level 3. At this level in the game, I had picked up combat spells and had an AC of 12. No mage hand or mage armour. The character is a diplomat and travels the world to learn more about war tactics for his end goal. His spell choices are either combat based(like witch bolt, fire bolt and stuff) or illusionary spells(like minor illusion and alter self given his interest in deception and people management). 

For some context, I make very few characters and usually end up indulging and making a super elaborate story for them. This particular character's story was possibly the best one I have ever done. (Let me know in the comments if you want me to elaborate on the story)

In the very first mission our party and were pretty much done with the first part of it. In one of the rooms, there was a dead warrior with what looks like good Armour. Given my character's interests, he walked up close to inspect. What happened after haunts my dreams since then. 

As we went to the body, swarms of what looks like worms hurried their way out of the body. Towards the party members. For the uninitiated, these are rot grubs. But, none of the characters know what these are and we try to get it under control.

Fortunately for the team, most of us made it okay. Unfortunately for me, 2 of the grubs went into my leg. Not sure what to do, I  used my action and bonus action to basically stab them to death through my flesh. I kill 1 of them. I get down to 0 hp and one of them is still in me. The party discusses cutting off my leg.

The DM pauses the game, pulls me to a separate room and tells me my options. 1, Die. 2, continue. Having worked on the character and this being just the first mission he was on for this campaign, I didn't want this to be the end of this character. So I choose option 2. 

We join the table again. My team goes for the leg and given my choice, they manage to get my leg off, with the worm not managing to get past the leg, thus not insta kill me. 

Now, here's the dilemma that I'm dealing with. Here I have a character that I'm having a hard time letting go. The DM gave me few options for what I can do with the limb situation. 
1. Prosthetic Limb permanently, use a prosthetic limb for the rest of the campaign. 
2. Get it healed now, where I would either have to pay an insane amount of money(which the character wouldn't have by a long shot) or pledge to do a favor for my healer, who would have the option to delimb me remotely if I don't follow the instruction. 
3. Get a temp Prosthetic leg and get it healed when I can afford it. 

Now,  the character has a perfectionist streak to them and when I was pondering on the options, it seemed natural for the character to give a big nope for the Prosthetic. Plus, as a player playing a sorcerer, it felt like the negatives outweighed the positives. For example,  
1. They take up an attunement slot for a long time possibly for the whole campaign, significantly reducing my magic items ability.
2. Won't be able to perform his go to spell, alter self as the metal leg is not counted as a limb and the spell is rendered non usable. 

But, as a player of DnD I didn't want to be that player who stays rigid in their way of things and affecting the DM's story. With that in mind, I am trying to find a solution to this situation. 

What do you all feel would be the best way to deal with this situation? What are your experiences with playing characters that lost a limb?

Was curious to get the community's take.

My world, as of right now is basically Earth where the world's history includes the mythologies and religions of people around the world. Dwarves hail from Scandinavia. Elves from Celtic regions. Odysseus is a historical figure as is King Arthur. The end result is sort of Witcher flavor, Assassin's Creed use of history, and God of War intertwining mythologies.

What I can't decide is if I wanted to drop out the history a bit by changing names/maps and the like. I think there's a lot of reasons for and against. I'd eventually like to share this work on reddit so I wanted to hear what reddit thinks about both choices.

On the one hand, getting to directly apply my research and recreate maps is a lot of fun. I also feel like giving placers, at the very least, a setting with which they already will have at least a surface-level familiarity may help with immersion; they will have a better sense of what questions to ask or decisions to make or conclusions to draw. They will know many of the gods, locations may be familiar.

On the other hand, history can be restricting. I am already changing many placenames and peoples' names for various reasons. I've also had to composite some figures due to the expanded lifespans of many races. I am already changing the stories by adding magical elements. So if I am already changing a little, why not go with a lot and free myself up to deviate more? This would look more like how GRRM was inspired by the War of Roses but made a unique setting.

*Everyone starts on an airship, first encounter is some civilian assholes who starts a fight*

*After everyone takes a short rest/introduce them self/first two npcs (dwarf musket man and stowaway child they find if they roll an insight check, if not they will reveal themselves later)*

*After that the airship is attacked by a fae dragon or two, these dragons have cast an illusion to appear as adult red dragons, after breaking the ship and making it slowly crash, they land on the deck and the first true combat encounter begins.
My party will either run away or try to fight, if they engage the illusion will wear off*

*After defeating/avoiding the fae dragons the party will see the captains quarters, with the door broken down and a pack of wolves circling the captains body (Magic item in chest) (it’s a hat that gives +1 to charisma)*

*Assuming the party wins the ship will have almost crashed, the dwarf musket man gets everyone that needs them parachutes but they don’t have enough, they have to choose between sacrificing the child (who revels themselves after hearing this) and sacrificing the dwarf that is the only one who knows where to go. Alternatively they could figure out a different solution (my sorcerer knows levitate)*

*When the surviving npc will tell them to find a gown . They eventually find a town after an encounter with 2-4 orks with some wolves*

*Eventually they arrive at a village, like the snowy skyrim one, make up the insides of the buildings, they can just be generic. Players can go talk to a blacksmith, or go to a tavern or just anything they feel like. Eventually via a job board or npc talking to them they will hear about a group of halfing cultists that are trying to summon a demon via capturing and sacrificing villagers*

The basic idea is that a human artificer gets bitten by a werewolf. Rather than using any magical or alchemical means to cure it, they take pride in their work and try to cure it with technology. But the project mostly fails and instead the curse just becomes unstable with random transformations back and forth at odd times. As an upside the werewolf is somewhat sentient, but really dumb by human standards. It also has its own alignment and personality. It's sort of a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde situation.

Practically speaking the DM would control when the transformation happens. The player can chose to either A: fight it (with a saving throw) B: Hide (so they aren't seen transforming) or C: Give in and let it happen.

Both the human and the wolf are playable with their own fighting styles, personalities and skills. But if you're unlucky and fail the saving throw you could become human mid fight.

446,Druid dealing with Forcecage,0,jenvn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/jenvn5/druid_dealing_with_forcecage/,14,1603223226.0,"So my 13th level Druid with playing in a campaign the other day, and we came up against a powerful Warlock. This Warlock cast Forcecage on me. Upon seeing that there was no way to dispel it, and upon seeing that I couldn't teleport out because all of my teleport spells require me to have a tree to walk into (Transport Via Plants and Tree Stride), I realized there was no way to escape this Forcecage. It doesn't sit well with my character though, because my character is kind of Batman-esque in the sense that he likes to have contingency plans. He likes to have a plan for every situation that could arise. Learning that there is a fairly common 7th level spell that can totally incapacitate him is discomforting. My character is trying to make a plan to deal with this spell. 
My question is: does anyone know of any ways to deal with Forcecage using Druid spells? I could teleport out if I had a tree, but I don't always have a tree. Does anyone know any spells that allow me to instantly grow or otherwise create a tree? Alternatively, what would happen if I cast Polymorph on myself to turn myself into a huge Beast? The spell specifies that if it's cast on a creature that's too large to fit in the Forcecage, the Forcecage shoves it out when it appears. What would happen if I cast Polymorph on myself and turned myself into a T-Rex while I was inside the Forcecage?",dnd

My suggestion is to create a scenario in which, during the plot of your campaign something goes horribly wrong. If a single player is leaving, maybe a wizard with a grudge against him casts some kind of horrible bad luck spell. If it's the whole party, maybe a magic item breaks and reality starts to fall apart. So rather than that campaign just stopping prematurely with no closure, the characters are guaranteed to die.

Artificer:

**Magical Tinkering**

At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic in objects that would otherwise be mundane. To use this ability, you must tinker’s tools, or other artisan’s tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

· The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.

· Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.

· The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.

· A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.

The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

You can give the magic of this feature to multiple objects, touching one object each time you use the feature, and a single object can bear only one of the properties at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with the feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.

### Spell-Storing Item

At 11th level, you learn how to store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus and store a spell in it, choosing one 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the Artificer Spell List that requires 1 action to cast (you needn't to have it prepared).

While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell's effect from it using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, that creature must concentrate.

The spell stays in the object until it has been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.

&#x200B;

Trait: • **Tinker.** You have proficiency with artisan tools (tinker's tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time. When you create a device, choose one of the following options:

***Clockwork Toy.*** This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.

***Fire Starter.*** The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.

***Music Box.*** When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed.

At your DM's discretion, you may make other objects with effects similar in power to these. The Prestidigitation cantrip is a good baseline for such effects.

&#x200B;

Feat: **Wondermaker** –

Prerequisite: Gnome (rock)

You master the tinker techniques of your people. You gain the following benefits:

Increase your Dexterity or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

When you make a check using your proficiency with tinker’s tools, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check.

When you make a device with your Tinker trait, you have the following additional options for what you make:

**Alarm**: This device senses when a creature moves to within 15 feet of it without speaking aloud a password chosen when you create it. One round after a creature moves into range, the alarm makes a shrill ringing that lasts for 1 minute and can be heard from up to 300 feet away.

**Calculator**: This device makes doing sums easy.

**Lifter**: This device can be used as a block and tackle, allowing its user to hoist five times the weight the user can normally lift.

**Timekeeper**: This pocket watch keeps accurate time.

**Weather Sensor**: When used as an action, this device predicts weather conditions in a 1-mile radius over the next 4 hours, showing one symbol (clouds, sun/moon, rain, or snow) for each hour

&#x200B;

(I need to sit and digest all this information. And am curious what all of you think. Off the top of my head, I am thinking of a distraction device, either to lure an enemy in or away. Also thinking of a ""mobile bomb"" or ""flammable oil delivery."" And an object that smells of food to lure away animals or hungry predators. And I am curious about using an image of mist/fog/cloud to obscure the object and make it difficult to attack.)",dnd

Thoughts?,2,jejhal,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/jejhal/making_my_first_homebrew_thoughts/,3,1603201411.0,"Making it based off of re:zero return by death because I'm such a nerd and I thought itd be a cool concept of an evil witch who is clingy and wont let them die, but one of 4 events happen every 4 days killing everyone returning them all to the start(should they last 4 days), the goal is to gain knowledge levels and a few magic items to eventually win. Basically every time they respawn each path will have a difficulty(1-4). This information is provided to the players by means of how well certain drinks are recommended(southern ale vs northern lager, i plan on being rather heavy handed on this mechanic). The four events are located one in each cardinal direction. I plan on making it take a day to get to each place until they discover an abandoned mine tunnel with carts that let them basically fast travel.

Basically I want to create it so that the safest way is to always go to whatever is difficulty 1 and if they have time then go to 2 until they hatch a plan to take care of all 4 world ending events, one being just them beating the final boss.

I plan to start the campaign with them at 5 or half health fighting an ancient white dragon(i think i want players to start lvl 5-10ish), once they all die, they hear the witch saying she wont let them die *she never will.* Like I want to bring a level of horror as they watch themselves die over and over again, but also to feel accomplished that they know more lore or now know a way straight to the boss in the west. Of course I plan to have rudimentary ways set up for them to be able cheese a lot of things, but I also plan to leave a lot of stuff out and just watch players be players.

So thats my current plan for my homebrew without getting into a lot of the specifics(like the Goose of Chaos, Herman, who can cast 3 random spells, not from a list, but from the whole list). I was jsut wondering if anyone had advise for a both first time homebrewer and DM. I have yet to build the encounters or dungeons(although a lot of encounters will need a range of difficulty depending on the seed it gets). I was jsut hoping for some sage advise or if someone finds this interesting some questions that help me flesh out my world a bit before I plop some of my poor poor friends into it.",dnd
491,Handling a potentially problematic player?,3,jejgqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/jejgqc/handling_a_potentially_problematic_player/,17,1603201338.0,"So I'm a new DM, and my party is, for the most part, comprised of new players, but one guy takes the cake. During Session Zero, there were a lot of question about fairly basic stuff- not unexpected, since it's almost everyone's first time and DnD is fairly complex for a first-timer. One guy, upon having stuff about the game explained to him, asked 'So it's all make-believe then?' and when talking about character options, asked if he could be Cthulhu. More recently in character-making, he sent me his character's personality stuff- backstory, bonds, flaws, etc. It was all decent except the alignment, for which he put Chaotic Evil (to be fair, I didn't explicitly disallow evil alignments). He also kept pushing for abilities that let him take allies' HP or inflict debuffs on them to boost his own damage. I vetoed all of that and pointed him towards pre-existing Warlock subclasses to choose from, since I definitely wouldn't be able to handle a CE PC without causing problems for the rest of the party. He took all that pretty well and seemed to understand that I wasn't going to let him do that, but not why- when I said 'you can't take your allies' HP to fuel magic BC that's not gonna be fun for them and they'd probably get mad at you' he said 'OK, makes sense, what if I just debuff them then?' I don't want to kick him out of the campaign, especially since we haven't actually started yet. But I'm afraid that he's gonna play without regard for the other players and make the experience less fun for the.. I did my best to impress on him that it was a collaborative experience with other people trying to have fun as well, but I'm not at all confident that he got the memo. I don't feel like doing something concrete now would be warranted, as he hasn't done anything YET, but I don't want to wait until he has caused a problem to clean up after and I don't think that a verbal reminder that he isn't the only one playing and the game isn't about him would be effective. Does anybody have any suggestions?

TL;DR Almost everyone is new, I have a player that seems like he's gonna end up playing an evil character (whether or not his alignment is technically evil) and make the game less fun for everyone else, and I don't know what to do about it.

EDIT: A lot of people are saying something to the effect of ‘tell him he’s not allowed to do that’. Which is good advice and much appreciated, but I have, and he accepts it, but only for the specific situation. If I say ‘you can’t steal HP bc that’s not fun for the rest of the party’ he gets that he can’t steal HP but picks other things that wouldn’t be fun for the rest of the party for basically the same reason, such as debuffing his allies. And I can’t preemptively cover everything he can’t do, and if I’m consistently blocking him at the table it’ll slow down the game and probably not be fun for him, either.",dnd

The ideas just pop off the page. I'm kicking off a new campaign, and two items interest me nowadays: the role the Dabus play and the overall role the factions play, as it seems nebulous.

On the first topic, the original box set and *In the Cage: A Guide to Sigil,* and further elaborated upon in the aftermath of *Faction War*, state that the Dabus provide basic ""public works"" throughout Sigil: cobblestone repairs and such, and, as a result, it turns out that the Fated have basically been pocketing the money. This does away with a source for internal conflict: if the Fated's taxation serves an actual purpose, then it gives a role for the various guilds and a role for the Guildhall Ward. My idea is this: the Dabus *do* certain public works, but those are entirely to serve the Lady. The features they maintain are intrinsically linked to Her stewardship of the gates, such as repairing the occasional door or window, or are echoed in the Mazes: the cobblestones on Carrion Walk are found in Factol Pentar's prison; the planks they replace on the walls of the Four Chain's can be found in a similar maze; etc.

The community role the factions place is also of interest. The Bleak Cabal, Godsmen, Dustmen, Harmonium, Fated, Guvners, Indeps, and Mercykillers fill straightforward roles. Even the Revolutionary League - they can easily fill the ""blue collar worker"" position, similar to the Indeps. But what of the Athar or Signers? The Doomsguard, Transcendant Order, and Sensates also don't have a real public role outside their official facilities. And then there are the Xaositects... Coming up with ideas for how each faction plays an economic role in the Cage will give each group life, even outside their primary locale.

**Xaositects:** The Xaosmen are typically there to throw whimsy at the players, or be a pain in the ass. How can they become someone with whom the players would *choose* to interact? What if they embrace alchemy and technology, without any fundamental understanding of the processes of the scientific process. They get results - but only by chance, and largely after causing disaster after disaster after disaster. Because they are largely confined to the Hive, the Harmonium see little purpose in trying to arrest their efforts (in both senses of the term).

**Sensates:** The Sensates run a network of festhalls, bars, concert halls, and galleries owned by the Sensates. In a quieter way, though, Sensates are an informal workforce for the guilds and as employees. They are generally regarded as incredibly flakey, although that is slightly unfair: most don't flit from job to job experiencing what they can, but enough do to give them a reputation.

**Doomsguard:** What is the Armory for? If it's for Civil Defense, who are they protecting Sigil from? Other than as pretty good criminal elements, what other formal role would the Doomsguard play?

Those are what I have so far. I'll keep coming up with specific ideas for locations in Sigil, focusing on the Lower Ward.",dnd

I'm DMing a longhaul campaign. Players are level 9 and they're in an Underdark arc.

One of my players originally played a lawful evil Oath of Conquest paladin/warlock multiclass teamed up with a Chaotic Evil Necromancer player. Both players are our best roleplayers. Paladin is very invested in his character and loves it to death.

Rest of the party is a mixture of Neutral/Good characters.

Paladin died, but had a ring of mindshielding. Paladin's mind is stuck in a ring, which is worn by the necromancer. Being an evil duo, both characters left the party so the Necromancer could try and raise the Paladin 'off-screen' into a Death Knight/Oathbreaker. The original plan was for both characters to come back to the party much later on in the game.

Enter players new characters. Neutral good Fighter tank (played by Necromancer), and lawful neutral Celestial Warlock inquisitor (played by Paladin). They're on a quest to rescue a dwarven princess from the Underdark.

Fighter is a monster slayer who joined the original party (+ Paladin before he died) on a dragon hunt, but fell out with the Paladin after he used eldritch magic to resurrect the dragon in service to his patron. Now the fighter hates the paladin.

Here's the trouble:

The Paladin player is very, very attached to his Paladin and wants him to return to the party. He's not been having fun with any of his other characters except the Paladin and finds D&D to be unfun without his Paladin. He feels like Warlock doesn't work with our playstyle. The Necromancer player is starting to like his fighter character more than his necromancer, as he feels being evil is too much work.

If the Paladin returns, the Fighter leaves. Either way, one person loses out on playing their preferred character.

I have tried giving the Paladin items for his Warlock such as a Rod of the Pact-Keeper and a ring of spell-storing, but he is still not enjoying D&D as his current character. I've also offered a class reroll.

The rest of the party has gotten along better with the Fighter than the Necromancer, and some have taken issue with evil characters.

I've been roleplaying with the Paladin behind the scenes, building up the eldritch, lovecraftian storyline he's become invested in for some sort eventual return.

The last thing I want as a DM is for one of my best role-players to lose interest in playing with us, as we've been going for at least an entire year or two.

Unfortunately, the PH does not provide any information, and the monsters guide (I forgot the proper title) only has vampire stats, with a tiny bit of unhelpful pc Vampire info. 

My question is, on becoming a vampire, does he then lose all Aasimar traits, as technically he has to die to become a vampire? for instance, the resistance to radiant/necrotic damage. Would that be lost, or would it stay and then balance out a vampire's natural weakness to it? Also, what about necrotic shroud/healing hands/light abilities? I love the idea of a vampire with those sick wings, sooo....

I would assume the character would not be allowed legendary resistance (and I wouldn't want it anyways) but what abilities would it get? I doubt all of them, but then which ones specifically? I have given him the weaknesses, inability to cross running water, disadvantage in direct sunlight, etc.... Has anyone done one of these before, and if so, any advice? Thanks in advance!",dnd

Anyways I say all this to say, my players have no idea how much their words mean. I'm writing a new campaign and to start it off I wrote three one shots for three separate groups to see if we like the setting and game style and honestly the one shot was a great time. I've only gone through one group so far but they loved it, it was a murder mystery and I wrote a ton of stuff down that didn't get used but it was a comfort to me and made me feel confident in my game. They ran through it, things got wild in the end when our Centaur Himbo decided it would be fun to start murdering the noble cause he's the killers husband. Things got crazy and half the manor crumbled into a mound on the hill. I had fun! I almost never have fun, I'm usually too anxious, but it all matched up. The music, the theme, the investigation, the engagement was all there.

Without going into too much detail, the BBEG is a villain with good publicity, who runs the wealthiest and most technologically advanced nation in the world (thanks, PCs from Arc 1). Think near-Eberron magi-tech in a setting where every other country is still on Faerun levels. In his quest to work against the players while also consolidating the power of his country, he has a new plan to set into motion: he is going to hand pick a team of adventurers, and turn them into a state-sponsored party. This will make his country look good to the outside world thanks to their heroics (stopping crises he sometimes engineers himself) and also allow him to work against the PCs covertly and overtly. 

Essentially a group of NPC adventurers whose main purpose is to steal glory from the PCs and make them look ineffective and/or just plain bad in the public eye. 

After all, this villain knows better than anyone that having the public on your side can be almost as much of an ace in the hole as a blade to the enemy's throat.

What I need help with is statting them. I'm no good at homebrewing enemies, so if anyone has any ideas or resources for a group of \~4 NPC adventurers, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Wild magic sorcerer seems chaotically fun, until you realize that its abilities only work with leveled spells (good luck doing that a meaningful amount of times at low-mid levels), and then only trigger 1/20 spells. DMs can improve upon these odds with tides of chaos, but since there is no RAW rules for how often they should do this, it's basically as likely to happen with any given DM as homebrews. TASHA'S SPOILER: >!Wild Magic Barbarian seems to have way more uses of wild magic, especially at level 10 where they can trigger it every time they're hit, but they have their own wild magic list that's less chaotic than sorcerer's.  !<

  

Arcane Archer and Ranger have the same issue for me: they're decent at archery, but the arcane is too diluted. AA only does a fun ""arcane"" effect twice per short-rest, and ranger doesn't have many spell slots and tends to just keep concentration on either swift quiver or hunter's mark instead of using other cool arcane spells.

A friend and I were theory-crafting some possible level up directions and I wanted to share this one and get some thoughts.

Kensei Monk 5 / Swashbuckler Rogue 4  
Str-10\*(9)    Dex-20\*\*(19)    Con-13    Int-10    Wis-16    Cha12

Movement:   35-Walk   60-Fly

Kensei monk weapons:   Rapier   Long Bow

Feats:   \*\*lv4-Slasher (UA)   \*lv8-Crusher (UA)

So the idea is combining the following abilities  
\- **TALONS**: You are proficient with your unarmed strikes, which deal 1d4 slashing damage on a hit.   
\- **FLURRY OF BLOWS**: Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.   
\-**Agile Parry**: If you make an unarmed strike as part of the Attack action on your turn and are holding a kensei weapon, you can use it to defend yourself if it is a melee weapon. You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and you aren’t incapacitated.   
\-**EXTRA ATTACK**: duh  
\-**SNEAK ATTACK**: Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.   
\-**FANCY FOOTWORK**: During your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.   
\-**SLASHER**: Once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack that deals slashing damage, you can reduce the speed of the target by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

577,Half breed race (thoughts?),0,jedti0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/jedti0/half_breed_race_thoughts/,13,1603179751.0,"Half Breed

When a human breeds with a magical animals or other half breeds, there is a 50% chance the child will be human, a 45% chance it will be a animal, and a 5% chance it will be a half breed. Half breeds posses traits of humans and animals, and are subsequently quite rare, especially in cities. 

Personality

They are usually polite,kind and honest creatures but due to the legends of there race growing worse more and more of them turn to murder,stealing and other crimes to survive.

Half breeds are usually of medium build, looking quite similar to humans except for the fact that their hairs are growing much faster, they have heterochromia (eyes of differing colors) they tend to posses powerful claws, sharper hearing, a better sense of smell and a furry tail usually between 5.6 and 6.9 feet. Their mainly carnivorous diet has caused them to posses sharp, canine teeth, ideal for tearing meat. They tend to be a more licentious, stronger, and more muscular than humans, due to their lifestyle of hunting and eating humanoids or animals.

Relations

They are depicted as monster to be avoided in almost all races except by the elves who know that they are not the monstrous creatures there legends say and in fact know of the true legend they hold, the legend of the beast king.

Alignment

A Half breeds alignment relies heavily on the way they are raised, for example if a half breed is raised by a loving and kind family they will turn out good and lawful but if raised in a bad way they can be anywhere from pure evil to neutral.

Lands

They will gladly dwell where their precense is not a bother, but forests and plains are their ideal.

Religion

Selûne is the main goddess the half breeds follow as she has taken in wearewolves before and they are such like them in certain ways.

Language

Since half breeds are a purely human occurrence, they speak common, but can 'converse' with wolves and dogs, too.

Names

Most keep the names they are given by their parents.
 
 
~He open his eyes to the screaming of eveyone in the town, he went down stairs and opened the door only to ask ""what is this monster!!!!?"" All he saw were the blood red eyes of the half breed who seconds later killed the man.When the beast was caught the executed him in the middle of the only half breed village, that village burnt to ash moments later along with the people who live there.~
 
This is the night that the race was cursed to a endless pain for one of there own had gone fully wield now all show be shown the same fate and sadness for they were no longer people they were now only monsters that needed to be ""cured"" of there beasthood.

I've followed some topics about this already to get a general understanding, but I'd appreciate some help on some other stuff:

1) I've never played a monk before, so what are some thing you would reccomend I should consider when in combat and for character progression? (i.e, the different 'Ways' that are available)

2) How does the Ki system work? I've looked it over in the PHB and I think I got a grasp on it, but I' pretty stupid and would appreciate if anyone can dumb it down a little for me

3) I'm considering taking the 'Grappler' featt when I can, as that could be flavoured greatly into certain moves (i.e, using the 'Shove' action but saying it's a suplex). I've seen some talk that it's really situational (I'm cool with that) but that it's also kinda bad?

The campaign is fairly standard but most of the characters are kinda edgy, and we have to play/plan over Discord due to the 'rona.

I came up with this backstory for my Tabaxi Artificer that she grew up in her tribe as a bit of an outcast and this made her bitter towards her species. Eventually leading to her burning down her village and fleeing to travel the world on her own. The DM told me he'd write in some extra lore so he could fit it into the campaign, which I was fine with. Except the lore he wrote for me was that I'd been gifted this magic gem by some spooky bloke that caused me to become enraged and burn down my village, then I fled and opened a shop in a nearby town. Which is less ""extra"" and more ""instead of"".

I kinda don't like how he wrote over the backstory I'd put a fair bit of thought into but I'm not sure if I should object. I know he did similar to the other players. He didn't intend for me to see the lore he wrote for me till the next session but I wasn't aware and read it anyway, so he's also slightly pissed at me because of that.

I've DMed before, being this groups forever DM, but this is the first time I bothered writing things down beforehand. The players had just gotten through a swamp area, where they killed a hag. One of the players invited a friend of theirs to the game, without even asking. They invited them because the guy had never played an TTRPG, unlike the rest of their class.

I wasn't too thrilled just letting a newbie join, but said nothing of it. I choked it up to me having heard too many RPG horror stories. Still, I wasn't fully comfortable, so I did the following. The day we'd normally play, I DMed a one-shot, and the regular session would be on the day after. It was to test out the player. The one-shot was a mystery about a ghost haunting a mayor's manor. If the new player ended up giving any red flags, I'd kick them out.

Surprisingly, they and the friend that invited them did all the work on solving the mystery. The other two players present did nothing, which was a bit disappointing. The player did make an edgy character, but I expected as much. It was harmless, anyway.

The next day, we play the regular session. The players character is introduced and the party heads to the large city they were planning on going. Upon arrival, they decide to rest at a tavern and choose the shady one have some fun. The new player instantly makes me regret allowing him in. He tries to start a fight with the barkeep. This was bad, as the obviously shady tavern was owned by the mafia and there were 10 other mafia members besides the barkeep. If it wasn't for another player stopping him and keeping him in check, the party would've been haunted by the consequences for the rest of the game.

Seeing as he couldn't do anything in that tavern, the player went to the tavern frequented by adventurers to find a mirror. He used that mirror to switch to his dark and edgy persona. He then proceeded to walk downstairs to the tavern area(the mirror was upstairs) and slammed the barkeeps head against the counter. Unsurprisingly, he gets surrounded by adventurers. He rolled high on intimidation, so he managed to leave, but if he had attacked what so ever, he'd be dead.

The last part was when he tried to break into the noble's area. Now, this wouldn't be bad normally. But he tried doing it by splashing water into the guards faces and quickly climbing over the wall. This, after the player that kept him in check already arranged to meet the person inside they were after anyway. So, he's now in prison. Luckily, it'll only be a fine. Unluckily, I don't think he'll be able to pay it and the others certainly won't help.",dnd

I think I remember that the setting was a darker fairy-tale world, in which apparently previous adventures have been set.

I have a question about the lore and also about my background story. But first I want to talk about the circumstances:

My group isn't new to P&P, but new to D&D. We wanted to play a different P&P and got stuck with the classic. But since we don't have any D&D experience, we decided to play a test campaign first and then the campaign we actually decided on. And here my problem begins. ""Frozen Sick"" is set in Wildemount and is therefore critical role content. Our ""main campaign"" we decided on is Tyranny of Dragons, which plays in the Forgotten Realms. That in itself isn't a big problem, our DM has written an ingenious little story about how we got transported to another world.

My problem is that my character is an elf. How does it look like with the lore there? The Critical Role Wiki says that ""Forgotten Realms lore is not canon to Critical Role"". So am I correct in saying that the elves from Exandria don't dream of their past lives, nor of the paradise that was denied from them? As the Critical Role Wiki doesn't mention this. (Hereby I would like to complain about the fact that this important part of their religion is NOT mentioned in the PHB...) s.

Another problem is my background story. In a nutshell, my character was left behind by her parents as a baby, because she doesn't meet the wood elf standards. But a human gangster boss takes pity on her and raises her instead of her parents. Growing up under human standards, she becomes an adventurer at the age of 22. Should the whole ""reincarnation thing"" (as I hope) not be canonical, this is definitely a legitimate background story, since the Critical Role Wiki considers the age of roundabout 100-110 years for an elf to grow up as a pure cultural decision of elves that has no biological basis. An elf, which was raised according to human standards, would therefore count as adult according to human standards. However, if the reincarnation cycle is also canonical in Critical Role, this background story doesn't work for several official reasons:

* Since she remembers former lives and paradise, she would still be bound to the elven norms by her previous knowledge.
* Since elves seem to hold their lives extremely sacred, it would be extremely unlikely that parents would leave their children to die.
* Since no new elves are born, no ""imperfect"" elves can be born, so the very reason why she was left behind would no longer make sense.

Waaay back, like 5 years ago or so, I was super into dragons in rpg's. I had just made a dragon commander deck in MTG and My buddy was hosting a Homebrew Pathfinder game. He invited me to play, so I was playing a guy who worshipped dragons. He had a breath weapon, wings, and a bunch of other characteristics. Eventually, around level 12 or so, the DM pulled me to the side and said ""Hey bud, do you just want to play a dragon? I can let you be a hatchling if you want.''

Unfortunately I wasn't able to take him up on his offer as the group devolved slowly soon after, but I would have loved to have done it. Since then, I've become a forever DM to a group of players for 5e and I've found a guy who I believe has the same passion I had for dragonkind.

It's a light blue crystal with thunder in it. It can be activated by swallow it. You can see how it glows under skin and it goes to palm. It moves slowly with huge agony.

Bonus lighting damage: 1d4 (6. lvl - 1d6, 10. lvl - 1d8, 14. lvl - 1d10, 18. lvl - 1d12)

If you roll 18 or 19 (so 10% on D20): You stun first enemy (if it doesn't have immune) and dealing 50% of damage (Rounded down) to nearest enemy in 10fts radius from the target. So if you roll 18 and deal 4 lighting dmg, the second deals 2 lighting dmg. I didn't want use 19 and 20. Because i thought double dices is not good idea with chain damage.

Time: 1 action

Range: 60 feet 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Concentration, 1 minute 

Classes: Wizard, Warlock, Sorcerer, Bard

You create a space where the laws of space and time are at your control. You choose a point you can see within range and create a field of energy in a 30 foot radius sphere. Upon casting and for the duration you can, as an action, manipulate the fabric of space as well as the objects in range:

· Swap: you attempt to swap your position with another creature or object. If the target is an unwilling creature, they must succeed a Wisdom Saving Throw or be moved against their will. If you are in a confined space or bindings, the target has to fit in the destination. If you are moving an object, it cannot be heavier that what you can carry.

· Rending: you attempt to strike through space itself, to bypass an opponent’s defenses. When you make a weapon attack or spell attack against a creature in range, you can add your spellcasting ability modifier to the attack roll.

· Distant strike: You extend your reach by reshaping reality. As long as you and your target are anywhere in the sphere, you can make a melee weapon attack or cast any spell with a range of touch as if they were within 5 feet of you

· Keening: When you make a melee attack, you can wrap your weapon or a piece of ammunition in layers of physical space, dealing an extra 2d6 force damage on a hit.

·Move Room: you may move the room to a new location in range. 

You can only benefit from one of these effects at a time. You may use a bonus action to choose a new effect each round.

649,Are Spellcasters boring?,0,je8k4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/je8k4f/are_spellcasters_boring/,34,1603164029.0,"Hey guys, sorry for the slightly dramatic title but has anyone else kind of felt that spellcasters are a bit ""boring""?

 

What i mean by that is that all of the class features seem to be extremely underwhelming, weak, unexciting or like a mix of all three.

&#x200B;

I think because of how powerful the ability to cast spells is, spellcasters have to have very bland/ limited (sub-)class features. As a result of that, subclasses for spellcasters feel rather undiverse or even kind of meaningless, because all of the ""mechanical characterization"" (the merging of the narrative idea of the character and the choice of mechanical options to fit that idea) happens with the choice of what spells a character takes. That however ends up being kind of ineffective once you consider that some spells are simply ""too good to pass up on"". Haste, Identify, Counterspell, Fly, Fireball etc are all spells that we have taken or seen taken a hundred times. When it comes to casters it feels like a choice between ""make virtually the same character everytime, because the toolset that you have is largely consistent of spells with which a few are simply *locked in* because they are so good."" and ""take spells that are flavourful to your character and fit, hoping there are enough of those in the first place and then hope those spells are not extremely weak, filling the same niche or extremely circumstantial.""

&#x200B;

Is that just me? Or does anyone else feel like they are playing the same/similar characters every time they roll a new spellcaster, simply because it seems like the subclasses dont really matter because the features are so few and far between and the spells are often the same too?",dnd

In trying to explain the crazy romance happening in the homebrew game I play in to a friend, I wrote this letter from the perspective of my PC.  I can't share it with anyone I play with, so I'm sharing it here. Hope you enjoy, and feel free to give advice to my poor PC  


Dear Agony Aunt,

I have a situation happening right now and need some advice. Buckle up, because this one is a fireball of a problem.

A lot of background: 

A few months ago one of my party members (M, 8yrs, Aarokocra) and I (F, 122 yrs, Moon Elf) accidentally got married when he gave me his family bracelet as part of a promise. He didn’t know what it represented, since he was exiled from his clan before he learned all his clans lore and culture. 

The bracelet is enchanted and the only way to remove it would be to complete an Aarocokran divorce ceremony (six months long, by Moonbow!). My people don’t really get married so we don’t have divorce. The bracelet represents our union, so now we’re stuck.

I’ve been alone for a long time, long story short my family is cursed to never lie and I was made to vow never to take a lover or partner. This makes the marriage extra complicated. We have been good friends since we met, so of all the people to be stuck with, he's not terrible.

I’m going to outlive him, even though recently he extended his life magically by 25 years, we have maybe 50 years together if we’re lucky. When we first met, he was very naïve, and didn’t understand all the parts of a marriage (yes, that part too). About a month ago, after an escaping noble eldritch knight delighted in torturing him with the gritty biological details, it was up to me to explain the softer, emotional side of things. Ever since then, he’s been more physically affectionate.

Before, he was less focused and more chaotic. Recently, he’s been changing and last night we had a long talk. He was gone for a few days and while he was missing, he got put through a series of trials with a local thieves’ guild where he had to choose between his old life and his new one, and he chose his new life. He chose me. After he told me about it, well… He kissed me before turning in for the night. 

The problem:

I’m scared of getting too attached. He died once before and it broke my heart. We were lucky and could get him resurrected but I never want to face that pain again. He’s less reckless in battle, but he still gets hurt enough to scare me.

Also, we (as far as I know) can’t have children together. I can’t help but feel like he’s going to meet some beautiful Aarakocra female and see what his life could be and grow to resent me. I care about him a lot, even though he’s pretty weird and has some disgusting habits. It’s getting harder to keep him at arm’s length, what do I do?

Sincerely,

Confused Bard

So, my character is a level 1 wizard named Baz in a party full of level 1 spellcasters. As far as roleplay I'm the only character that actually understands magic on an academic level. Everyone else knows magic exists, and that it can be used in various ways, but their powers are just now starting to manifest and they have no idea what the limits of magic are or what the various schools are. They don't even know that there's a difference between divine magic and arcane magic.

After two weeks now of the party being utterly mystified by their own abilities, Baz is done with everyone being clueless and not understanding what they're doing. Baz starts explaining the basics of magic and everyone seems to understand, so Baz satisfied. Then we get to the next day and it becomes obvious that everyone clearly didn't understand when we get into the next combat. 

One very rough combat later and Baz has decided that if they're going to act like children about this, he's going to teach them as if they're children. So he pulls one of them (named Ara) aside as says: ""Look. You've got powers now so you need to understand what they're about. Yes you can cast spells, but there are certain basics you're just lacking and I simply won't have it. So repeat after me: (singsong voice) I is for Illusion, it's not what you can see...""

And my whole table erupts into laughter.  I went on to explain that Baz has a full nursery rhyme type song that explains the schools of magic, and he wants Ara to memorize it so she knows the schools. My fellow players immediately decide that they need to know the rest of the song, and Ara spends the rest of the session following Baz saying things like: ""What was the Necromancy rhyme again?"" And: ""Was it Comp-juration's are for making things?""

At the end my DM says ok! You've all leveled up, so prepare that for next time and also OP needs to have figured out an actual rhyme by next session.

And I think I'll run it like everyone who casts a spell in the zone has a 1/20 chance to cause a wild magic surge. 

But if a wild magic sorcerer happens to cast a spell in the zone they have a 5/20 chance of causing a wild magic surge, because they already have wild magic inside em.

Basically you are in a room with 2 exits. One leads to death and one to freedom. There are also 2 guards. One who always lies and one who always speaks the truth. You can ask them questions but they only answer with yes or no. so with a tricky question you have to find out the correct exit.

I think my first mistake was that my party was allowed to ask more than one question, but i dont wanted to be an ass like if they dont get it the first time then: ""haha youre all dead."".

But the best thing was something i didnt expect.  
My barbarian player went to both guards and asked them: ""if i hit you with my sword, will you be destroyed?"" The truther says no and the liar says yes. Then he just tried it and obviously these guard statues cannot be destroyed.  
After that they could just go to one guard and ask: ""is this the right way?"" and take the correct one.

So the Barbarian just used his own methods and broke the puzzle in under 1 minute.

First Idea: Start off with levels in rogue, later gain 2 levels of paladin so I can heal and smite. 

Other Idea: If my aasimar (his name's Lucien btw) decides to choose an Oath, it would most likely be Oath of the Open Sea (the new paladin oath by Matt Mercer). Perhaps 10+ levels of rogue swashbuckler and 3+ levels of paladin.

So I would like a build that is effective at doing damage, but can also charm the pants off anyone. He would start off with expertise in persuasion and stealth, then later expertise in acrobatics and deception.

702,Opinions on this character?,1,je5d0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/je5d0t/opinions_on_this_character/,6,1603154971.0," 

Hey guys, I'm fairly new to DnD and have thought of a concept for a character.

More often than not, when I make a character based on an idea or two that i had thought of and evolved, I think it sounds really good until i put pen to paper, finding out its actually horrible.

If anybody would like to give me a second opinion before i finish off and finalize this character, I would love to hear it, I am open to suggestions.

So anyway, here goes. (please bear with me, i am a TERRIBLE story teller)

The character I have put together is a female human, whom i will call Faika for now (don't ask why, just a random name).

Faika is a farm girl from a very poor village. This village neighbors a forest that is home to a few weak beasts, however with no help of capable fighters, many lives have been lost to those that stray out of the forest and attack innocents.

Faika and her father have had to live off a small plot of land that can barely feed the two while also paying for the land (mother is unknown and has no known siblings). Her father is actually a very knowledgeable man and despite the enormous workload needed to pay of land and live, he managed to home school her almost every day and gave her the knowledge that many people in the village could never have. In her younger days she would see her friends and often share some of these packets of knowledge with them.

being such a poor and small village, everybody got on well, learning to help each other when possible and sharing any available resources to each other.

While this backstory isn't very impressive, i thought it'd work for why she becomes an adventurer.

She becomes an adventurer when her father becomes deathly ill (or kidnapped by higher power for some reason, remember this is still in the works) and the land is not enough to pay for a service to heal him (or pay the ransom). The only job that she can think of being profitable enough quickly enough is the role of adventurer, putting her life on the line for coin despite never having any experience of violence, killing, or harming others.

The class i ended up choosing for her is the druid class. I believe that a good enough reasoning behind this would be an encounter with a dire wolf in the neighboring forest. Whilst being young an dumb, she adventures into the forest, despite all warnings, thinking this huge forest is gorgeous, she ventures deep inside, where the danger increases, eventually, she comes across a large wolf, at first she is terrified and fall over backwards (cliche style) until finally realizing that the wolf means no harm to her. After calming down and getting closer to the wolf, she is allowed to pet it, ride it and so on. after hours of lost time in playing in the woods she can hear the yelling of her father, screaming her name, along with a multitude of the other villagers, looking for her. Riding piggy back on her new friend she returns to her father and villagers, whom are obviously threatened and terrified of the creature, convinces them all to spare it and all go home. Scolded all the way back and grounded (as you do).

Throughout the years growing up she constantly snuck into the forest to be with the wolf, talking to the other creatures of the forest too and befriending them, eventually learning that she can commune with them (or whatever else she can as a druid). Despite learning that she has such a power, she didn't get chance to train with it or anything of the sort due to the huge workload her and her father still had to endure.

Sorry, that was a lot of backstory, I like writing them lol.

now into stats.

I wanted a more heavy RP character instead of a combat one I guess, I chose to allocate stats (point buy system) into what i thought would fit her background, 16 str, 13 dex, 15 con, 14 int, 10 wis, 10 cha. my reasoning is under here.

16 in strength (manual labor from farming, digging etc) 13 in dexterity (i felt that this would fit from the manual labor an constant running around in a trip hazard full forest) 15 constitution (again, running round in a thick forest would cause a lot of build up from falls, trips, scrapes and so on, also the labor would have helped endurance if that makes sense) 14 intelligence (from her brilliant father) 10 wisdom (i understand that this is an important stat for a druid but i believe that it would suit her as a naive girl being out of the village for the first time out of resource runs to other villages and towns) and finally 10 charisma (I she her being very likable however not knowing how to talk to people out of her small circle of people and animals).

as for equipment she has simple leather armor, a sickle (from the farm), a spear, a spig of mistletoe as a druidic focus and a simple kit consisting of a tinderbox, bedroll, mess kit, 50 ft of rope, a torch, a water skin, a day of rations and a backpack.

If there's anything you'd think i should change or add I'm all ears.

And if you don't have any suggestions, I'd still love to hear your opinions :)

Also if anybody is looking for players I'm still looking for a group haha....",dnd
703,I made a Lynel build from Legend of Zelda as a Barbarian/Artificer,6,je5ckl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/je5ckl/i_made_a_lynel_build_from_legend_of_zelda_as_a/,0,1603154931.0,"A few months ago, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/3d6/comments/hrfx7p/lynel_build_from_legend_of_zelda/) to reddit asking people how they thought I could build a [Lynel](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Lynel) from Legend of Zelda, specifically Breath of the Wild. Since then, I've come up with a build I think really fits the *feel* of a Lynel, and gets around all the issues of trying to build such a multi-talented creature in 5e. Note that this is not an optimized build, and can be pretty MAD, but who cares when you get to be a badass fire-breathing lion-headed centaur? I love the Legend of Zelda, and Lynels really made a name for themselves as the most dangerous enemies in Breath of the Wild, so let's get into it!

Here are my goals for the build:

* **Horse body**. I don't think anyone would be shocked when I say we're picking centaur for our race, but it does pose some limitations on where we can take the build stat-wise, at least until Tasha's comes out.
* Good in **melee** and at **range**. Already we're seeing the challenge to make this build work, as Lynels are clearly *jacked* and bows use Dexterity, but we'll find a way to address this.
* **Breathe fire**. The hardest part of the build to accommodate. While a gish build would normally work, barbarians can't cast spells while raging. We could become an Eldritch Knight instead if not for two reasons. First, they rely on armor, which Lynels don't use. And second, Lynels are definitely barbarians, not fighters, as they roam the wilds by themselves and rely on their strength, speed, and toughness instead of training. The armor you make from their drops is even called the ""Barbarian Set."" Of course, if you don't mind deviating a bit from the source material, an EK build would be more straightforward and less MAD than this build.

**Lynel**

>""*These fearsome monsters have lived in Hyrule since ancient times. They possess intense intelligence, resilience, and strength, making them amongst the most dangerous monsters in all the land. This is compounded by the fact that they have a natural resistance to all elements. You would be wise to challenge a Lynel only if you're very well prepared.*""  
>  
>— [Hyrule Compendium](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Hyrule_Compendium)

# The Build

**Ability Scores:** We pick Centaur as our Lynel's race, which gives us +2 Strength and +1 Wisdom. As we can see from the in-game description, we want to focus on Strength, Constitution, and Intelligence. Using point buy, we end up with 16 Str, 12 Dex, 14 Con, 14 Int, 10 Wis, and 8 Cha. As you can see, we need a lot of stats, but fortunately even as an artificer we don't need too much Int, as most of what we're using will deal half damage even if enemies make the save often from our low DC.

**Background:** Outlander is really the only thing that makes sense, and gives you a nice thematic survival feature.

**How the Build Works:** Now you might be thinking, ""Hey, how the heck are you going to breathe fire as a barbarian? You said it yourself, you can't cast spells!"" The key here is in the Artificer levels, specifically the Artillerist's Eldritch Cannon. This subclass feature lets the Lynel build a Flamethrower cannon as a small creature and have it ride on their equine back, leaving their hands free to wield weapons while spewing fire everywhere as a bonus action. The cannon also gets around the no spells rule, as you only need a bonus action to activate it, no spellcasting involved. A hand-held Force Ballista cannon serves as the Lynel's ""bow,"" allowing us to ignore Dex.

While I'm sure some DMs out there would rule that the flame turret's attack would hit the Lynel too, the rule does say ""an adjacent 15ft cone,"" and since the Lynel is taking up the same space as the turret, they wouldn't get hit. I like to imagine the cannon as a lion-maw mouthpiece or mask connected to your saddlebags, but you can flavor it however you like.

# Progression

The base build is **Bear Totem Barbarian 5 / Artillerist Artificer 3**, with a few options on where to go from there. Of course, if you want to get fire breathing as soon as possible, start with your 1st level in barbarian, then get your 3 artificer levels right away.

**Barbarian 1 -> 5:** As with most multiclassing, it's usually better to stick with one class until level 5. Starting out in Barbarian gives us nice proficiencies, great saving throws, and the highest base hp in the game. Lynels in the game use several different weapons, so pick your favorite. Sword and shield for the AC, glaive for range, or maul for big damage. Of note here, before you have anything else to do with your bonus action, your centaur Charge gives you an extra attack to apply your rage damage with.

For our subclass at 3rd level, we'll pick the Bear Totem Warrior, giving us our ""natural resistance to all elements"" from the previous description. Tiger would be the closest to a lion, but it's really bad and jumping doesn't help the build at all. We don't want any other subclass since almost all of them gain a bonus action feature, and we need ours for our Artificer cannons. Finally we get an ASI in Str or Con, whichever you feel you need more, and the all important Extra Attack.

**Artificer 1 -> 3:** At first glance a hulking wild Lynel doesn't seem like it would fit as an Artificer, but it makes more sense than you might think. Lynels make and upgrade their own weapons, and they are some of the best in the game. And while they don't really cast spells, neither do a lot of Artificers, who use technology infused with magic instead. Elemental infused arrows, even bomb arrows? Very Artificer.

Our first two levels of Artificer aren't that great, since we mostly get spells, but the Infusions will help us shore up our weaknesses. Good options are Enhanced Defense, Enhanced (Mighty!) Weapon, or some helpful magic items. At 3rd level we get our quintessential Eldritch Cannon, giving us our fire ""breath"" and letting us deal with crowds, or wielding a Force Ballista ""bow"" and sniping distant foes, both of which normal barbarians often struggle with. And while Artillerists normally struggle with keeping foes in range of their fire turret without putting themselves in harms way, that's where a barbarian excels.

Of course, creating a cannon does take a full action and has to be on an *unoccupied* space, so either try to build one before combat, or start combat by rushing towards a group of enemies, creating a turret, then activating it to attack and climb onto your back in the same action. We also get Shield, an amazing spell that every gish wants, though we can't use it while raging, and Thunderwave serves as our huge roar attack.

**Levels 9 -> 20:** 8th level is where the build really defines itself as a Lynel build, and the rest of your progression is less stringent. Here are some options:

* **Barbarian 17 / Artificer 3:** This is the most straightforward and probably best build path, increasing your damage and survivability. Your 6th level feature is mostly fluff, but taking Eagle gives us mini darkvision, which is a weakness we're happy to patch up. Continuing as Bear is another decent pick. 7th level makes us even faster, and 11th level gives us even more survivability. 14th level has much stronger options, but make sure to avoid Elk, Tiger, and Wolf, which all give us a redundant bonus action. Bear is the obvious choice to force enemies to focus on your ferocious visage, but Eagle is surprisingly on flavor, as Lynels do make large leaping attacks and movements. Gallop in, smack your enemies around, and roast them alive.
* **Barbarian 9 / Artificer 11:** This version is not as good, as there are several dead features and we don't care much about higher level spell slots, but there are some key features that make this level spread a possibility to consider. Arcane Firearm at 5th is nearly useless, and Flash of Genius is only alright since our Int isn't very high. We do get better Infusions at 6th, and those do help the build out a lot. If you want, you could even stop here. At 9th level, we hit the next feature we were investing these levels to get: Explosive Cannon. The damage increase is great, and we can detonate our cannon in a pinch to mimic a Lynel's charged explosion attacks. We also get Fireball for the same purpose, but BIGGER. Our last two levels are key, 10th level giving us some very powerful Infusion options, particularly the *gauntlets of ogre strength* and the *headband of intellect*.  Pick the one that you haven't invested in (probably Int) and suddenly your MAD build has plenty of stats to go around. 11th level gives us Spell-Storing Item, a powerful ability that lets us break our build's constraints and *cast a spell while raging.* The wording on the feature says a creature only needs to use an action to activate the item, not the cast a spell action. We have plenty of options to choose from, though we probably want attack spells to maintain our rage if we haven't taken any damage. Take the last 4 levels to 20th in barbarian for an ASI, powerful class features, and increased rage damage. Your melee damage and survivability isn't as good, but you're gonna do decent area damage and have a lot more options than most barbarians get, especially with all your magic items and infusions.
* **Fighter 1 - 4:** A third multiclass might be pushing it a bit, so let's look at the trade off. Assuming we're taking fighter levels instead of barbarian levels, 1 level delays our meh Aspect of the Beast for a Fighting Style and Second Wind. That's a pretty good trade off, especially if you're using a sword and shield, as the damage increase brings you closer to a two-handed weapon's damage. The AC bonus from Defense style is nothing to sneeze at either. Just stopping there is already worthwhile, but we can go further. Another level gives us Action Surge instead of an ASI, though at level 20 we do end up losing a point of Rage damage, which is something to consider. Action Surge is great though, and gives nova capabilities. We can build a turret or shoot a fireball, action surge, rage, run in, and attack, all on the first turn of combat. Here's where I'd recommend stopping, but you could go *further beyond*. Here you get a subclass, and there are plenty of choices. I won't go into much detail, but I'd say Battlemaster is the best choice, followed by Champion. Avoid anything that gives you a bonus action feature. The trade off is your Persistent Rage, which I'd say is a worthy exchange. Finally, if you reeeeally want to, you can get a fourth level for an ASI, but you lose your powerful 14th level Totemic Attunement. Not especially worth it.

# Options

**Features:** Most of your ASIs should be focused into stat boosts until your Str and Con are at 20, but feats are more fun and there are some good options to choose. Great Weapon Master is always good for barbarians, so pick it up if you're using a maul. Sentinel will keep your allies safe and net your more attacks for more rage damage. Observant is a decent on-theme pick to make you as keen-eyed as the Lynels are in BotW. Lucky is good on anyone. Again, avoid anything that gives you a redundant bonus action.

**Spells:** Since we'll mostly be raging in combat, and our Int won't be good enough without serious investment, we want to mostly avoid damage spells. If you do take damage spells, look for ones with saves that still deal half damage on a success. Utility spells we can use out of combat are also good options.

**Cantrips:** We'll take Mending to keep our turret healthy, and Guidance is always great. If you want damage, get Thunderclap (reflavored as a roar), or Firebolt (fired from your mouth!).

**1st level spells:** Plenty of utility rituals here, pick between Identify and Detect Magic. False Life makes you even tougher (the temp hp is essentially doubled with Bear Totem resistance), and you can cast it before combat. You could pick up Cure Wounds to save allies (or yourself) in emergencies, or Feather Fall so you can jump off cliffs and not care. Absorb Elements would be a great pick on a different build, but we can't use it while raging and we already have resistance to everything except psychic damage.

**2nd levels spells:** Almost everything good at this level requires concentration, so there are only a couple things we can use. Aid is a great party-wide buff that lasts 8 hours, without concentration. You don't have darkvision, so Darkvision is a decent choice. Pyrotechnics is alright, and stays nicely on theme.

**3rd level spells:** Much better than the last spell level. Give something magical a growl and watch it crumble with Dispel Magic. Glyph of Warding isn't very thematic, but explosions are good. Same with Revivify, but it's so powerful you'll be thankful when it comes in clutch. Maybe you roar your allies back to life?

# Other Builds

The above is the build I personally think matches a Lynel as portrayed in the game and its lore the closest, but if you don't mind adjusting your Lynel from the source material here and there, there are a couple other builds that definitely do the job.

**Eldritch Knight:** Playing an Eldritch Knight makes this a lot more straightforward, if you don't mind wearing heavy armor instead of letting your hardened pecs turn away damage. Grab the Dragon's Breath 2nd level spell at 7th level and bam, Lynel build achieved. You also get to actually concentrate on spells, so buff yourself up and go ham. Enlarge will beef you up to true Lynel size. Wield a Flameblade with Green-Flame Blade. Cast Fireball, Haste yourself, or make a quiver of Flame Arrows and shoot Link while he tries to shovel food down his gullet. Your bow skills will be lacking, but just throw some javelins or cast a ranged cantrip instead.

**Storm Herald:** While they don't really have a ""breath,"" the Storm Herald Barbarian's Desert Aura comes close enough, and that's what reflavoring is for, right? The progression is a lot easier, and you still get to keep the barbarian flavor. You even have three different Lynel types: Red (desert), Blue (sea), and White (tundra)! Again, not good with a bow, but everything else feels very Lynel.

# Conclusion

That's the build! I think it does a good job fulfilling the Lynel fantasy. I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I did making it. I put a lot of effort into making silly builds like this work, and the Lynel definitely deserves it. I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts! Is an Artificer too weird for a Lynel? Did you think of another build you want to mention? Have you calculated the damage and want to share what the build can do? Is there a different Zelda character or enemy you would like to see built in D&D? Any questions or clarifications about the build? Did I make a typo anywhere?

Obviously, the straight answer here is Roll20's dynamic lighting. That would work perfectly. That being said I'm a broke college student, and my playgroup uses google drawings for our games (which, trust me I have tried, is impossible to make work with any sort of vision accuracy).

When we are in combat, which is the majority of time we have character deaths, I always feel that it sucks when a PC dies because of a couple of bad rolls. It's like ""oops - you died because you crit failed"". Even ""As you swing your great axe, screaming your battle cry, you slip on the corpse of the disemboweled Throat-Vulture, landing stunned in front of the goblin hoard, who gleefully pounce on your defenseless body, tearing you to shreds in moments."" doesn't feel like it carries the gravity of the moment.

We started with Dragon of Icespire Peak which I modified heavily to give it more of a story than a loose set of notice board quests. Eventually, they completed that and I was out of module content. I cooked up a plot hook and sent them to Waterdeep, only to find how absolutely nerve-wracking it is to do.

The Forgotten Realms is a canon setting with lore and history to it that I cannot change. Yet, I can't find anything that has every building in Waterdeep. I've had to make NPCs but panic every time I do in case I'm overriding something that already exists, or misinterpreting the limited info I can find. The players seem to enjoy it but I'm really struggling behind the scenes to have something that makes sense and works in the world already established. Like, I've just been guessing how the city guard/watch work, I've had to make up a Senior Civilar since the Wiki didn't list any names for any of the wards. I have no clue how the courts work, how deaths are handled, etc. I also am guessing at how the guilds work, and I don't have a list of every notable guild member, or how their guildhalls work on the inside. Hell, I came up with a main floor for the Tower of the Order and it's just a bunch of labelled desks!! I hate that it's probably incorrect to the canon but I couldn't find anything.

Like, after this I want to send them to Menzoberranzan. But, since they're not Drow, how would they enter Menzoberranzan without being enslaved and slaughtered? How does the city operate? Are there inns? How much do they cost, what's the innkeeper's name? What is the City of Spiders' daytime life like? The nightlife? Names of businesses and business-owners? Who are key people? What are the houses like, and what are the names of their members? Where are the maps of certain Drow house manors/estates? What about maps for interiors of key buildings in the city? These are all things rushing through my mind whenever I try to think of setting something up. I worry about coming up with stuff in case there is a document somewhere that has just what I'm looking for.

I feel like I need to read every Forgotten Reams-set book all the way from the beginning to now, but don't have the time. So what I'm asking to fellow DMs: **how do you do it?** How do you deal with the stress of setting up fun stories while also maintaining the canon of the Forgotten Realms?",dnd

Of those, for those wanting to become knight and protect the land. For maidens who husbands leave for war, it is a tale of hope, sorrow, and one that loved ones tells and hope those who leave will always be safe and return home safely no matter where their duties may take them. Now this tale begins with a kingdom who's nobles and king let the power get to their heads. The wealth consumed them. They became corrupt and began to seize land of the commoners and the poor. Taxes became heavy and citizens began to starve and began to turn to thieves to steal food and more violent ways. 12 lowly knights stepped up and started to farm, and grow, and steal food. They became heroes of the people. The city guard numbering three thousand strong, highly trained soldiers began to hunt them down to execute them and put this to shame. Five of the knights stood up facing certain death to allow the other seven to escape. These knights an Archer, a Shield Meister, a Swordswoman, a Blood hunter, a Spearman, a Paladin, and a Magician. Together these seven became legendary warriors, strategists, and excellent teachers, each raising a small army of around 400 each to their dedicated style. The people rallying close to three thousand stood up and fought many bloody battles. After many months of planning and fighting the seven heroes and their chosen champions reached the grand hall only to be surrounded by their own mentors and family for this final, gruesome battle. As gruesome as it could be the battle was over in mere moments with the hero's as the Victor's. Their chosen champions perished in battle as well as they suffered many wounds. This became the Grand Capitol Tradegy. The hero's split the continent up into eight kingdoms one for each hero to rule and an extra one solely for the people who all decided to use as farming land to make sure the land would never run out of food. This became the Coast of Greed,  city of Rivica, their harbors brought in merchants and traders and they began using this land to make money. Hundreds of years later the kings and queens raged war against one another as their greed took over and wanted more and more. These wars are still being fought today. The kingdom of Rivica finally tasted peace even if only for a short time. 
              Fall of the seven knights began after the peace, any survivors from the previous kingdom gather, any lords and nobles left alive or who escaped ran and ran. Shortly after they gathered their own small army of slaves. A new king rose up from the crowd of these survivors. They attacked a small kingdom known as Luax and took control over it's people and land. They began to muster their forces expanding this kingdom by almost twice its size in less than a year. This is when they began their assault against their old homeland. They caught  the seven knights off guard. When they were enjoying peace farming, forging, teaching, ect. Enjoying their new and free lives. All in the span of a year the knight fell, killed in their sleep, slaughtered in their workplace, or simply ambushed. The people's moral hit an all time low, their hero's slaughtered and not a clue left about. The nobles and lords began attacking their old home. The people began to fight once more. For their ideals. All of a sudden the news spread like a wildfire in a forest. The attacking kingdom of Luax had their king and all the main guards slaughtered in less than a day, Under the cover of a small riot a single woman with hair of obsidian. They have survived and outlived their attackers, the kingdom of Luax. Luax crumbled and it's own people destroyed the kingdom. Eventually with out the seven knights of Rivica, the kingdom of Luax was invaded by goblins, imps, direwolves, and other monsters inhabited this destroyed land and they have lived there for many years to come.
                           
      Hidden Lore
            In ancient times, there was a king who went mad, he sacrificed his people to demons, and other creatures of the dark. He taxed them heavily and slaughtered any who could not afford. The kingdom, Luax (who-ics), suffered a small riot by it's people, and on that faithful day, a dragon flew by in scearch to fulfill his hunger. The dragon noticed this riot with its keen eyes and got curious as to what was happening and decided to take a look herself. The dragon morphed into a human, in a silk, black dress covered in precious gemstones, her bosom overflowingly ample, her hair as beautiful as the night upon a new moon, her skin softer then the dress she was wearing, a perfect alabaster color. She had a slim figure and caught the eyes of many nobles and lords of this kingdom. She inquired about the riot and the lord's and nobles responded with distaste for their people and the poor commoners who could not survive with taxing as heavy as this. The dragoness made her way to the riot. And as she was trying to persuade the people to calm down she was struck with a blade, in her back, she fell coughing up blood. The poor commeners then attacked the guards and tried to make their way to the king. The dragoness furious, started cursing them and changed back to her dragon form. The people were shocked at what has transpired. She then slaughtered the people and then the guards. She destroyed the kingdom and made her way to the king, killing all in her path. At last she reached the king, and started to curse him for his cruel behavior and his cruel ways of treating his people. Terrified, he began to beg for his life, and she laughed as he was the first to beg her during her slaughter. She then cursed him for his cowardice and slayed him, while he was still on his throne. As this happened she heard a shriek and turned to a maid holding a baby girl, the kings first born. She slayed the maid and took the child. The rest is lost to history as only the dragoness knows what was done with the child. Some say her hair was that of pure obsidian. Some say that she ate the child, some say she raised it, however the dragons first and only appearence was moments before the slaughter and she was lost to history. Only those who survived know about this bit  of hidden lore.",dnd

So to cut to the meat, I'm looking into DMing on my stream, and would like some advice, warnings, tips, tools, words of encouragement(?) Anything to help honestly !

Some background on my experience:

-I have been playing DND for 12 years now (since I was 13) , started in 4e, moved to Pathfinder after a few years then on to 5e and never looked back.
-I have been a DM most of that time, sporadically in the beginning while we learned-everyone took turns-and then I became the ""stand-out"" in our group of 6/7 people.
-I have DMd remotely before, using Roll20. In fact I did it for a short burst in the beginning of Covid, too before people's schedules didn't line up.
-I have watched SOME critical role, acquisitions incorporated, and listened to the whole Balance Arc of Adventure Zone.
-I have been streaming since June and hit affiliate last month (woo!) so I have some decent experience with streaming tools.

Some things to know about the situation/goal:
-This is going to be a mostly/all streamer game. My plan is to have everyone do push/toggle to talk over discord to avoid constant chatting with viewers, and to instruct them to focus. The group is actually rrally incested, good people so they should be fine , i think.
-I have always used a map, as I started with 4e and we've usually been in person, and I like drawing dynamic maps (I once used a scroll-like paper to simulate a ship combat, as the ships moved forward, i pulled the scroll and revealed more!)
-I'd like to move more towards theater of the mind, if possible. I've done this before in individual encounters but never committed to it for a whole game/campaign. I think this will better engage the players and the audience remotely, and allow us to be more efficient with our time.

First I thought about kobolds, since they are tinkerers and such, but they don't really go around that much, you usually have to fight them in their lair.

Then I thought about goblins, but they are kinda boring and wouldn't really be tinkerers I feel like.

This Campaign Setting will be created to be played with any edition of Dungeons and Dragons especially since many aspects of it is closer to other D&D settings and ideas.

749,My players didn’t want the session to end.,5,je33j1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/je33j1/my_players_didnt_want_the_session_to_end/,5,1603148059.0,"I’m DMing a Planescape-style 5e campaign, set in a homebrew version of what is basically the Outlands. Really weird fantasy-esque landscapes like the Overdark, a desert that grows crops at an alarming rate, and is effectively a plane of several demiplanes merged into one. My players are a mix of natives or people that have been blipped here through various means, so the cast is really a motley crew of various adventurers.

We’re playing through Elemental Evil right now, although it’s taken some scaling up now that they’re around level 13. We started with the Cult of the Black Earth, the earth-aligned evil cult, so they’ve been wading through cultists, earth elementals, duergar, and a couple burrowsharks. Their journey into the temple was a bit harsh, with traps and some really stacked odds, but I’ve seen them handle everything I throw at them, with rests when appropriate. Compared to the encounters I built prior to the module dungeon, the Temple of Black Earth has been a lot more straight forward for them. 

Now, being a game of mostly homebrew components, I felt obligated to add a bit to the dungeon. I first introduced an NPC of lower level to draw some of the aggro from enemies, and a tomb before the entrance to the dungeon that once held a mummified drow and her infant child. Both of which were buried alive, and subsequently reanimated, leaving the party on a side quest to reunite this drow mummy baby with her mother. Second, I wanted the various factions with the cult to have some infighting, because dogpiling would have been expected after their rather dynamic entry to the temple, practically blowing the doors off.

So I’m in the middle of last night’s combat encounter, the party is facing down an elemental, a group of hobgoblins that I leveled up to Warlords, and a burrowshark with his bulette mount. DPR was through the roof as it was, and halfway through the encounter some high CR duergar join the battle. Our Druid placed a strategic Wall of Fire between us and them, and fire damage ensued. Two Hobgoblins came under the effect of a Geas, which led the cleric out of the fight to a hot spring in the dungeon to heal up from the previous encounters, intending on taking the Druid with them. Bottom of initiative comes the burrowshark. Now, without the party’s knowledge, I had been rolling Animal Handling checks since the Duergar joined initiative. Last round of combat, the burrowshark fails.

In the midst of an already tense combat, the bulette goes berserk, and ganks the duergar, leaving the earth elemental, who joined the duergar dogpile, and the two Geas’d hobgoblins. The party, given the opportunity, fled this more than deadly encounter with the hobgoblins in tow. A much needed hot bath ensued, and hit point were regained. Hobgoblins were hired, and the party continued on their quest of the mummy family reunion. Party returns the necro-baby with little resistance, and in return is rewarded with the Big Boss Key (cue Zelda item discovery).

Before the party goes to throw down with Marlos Urnrayle, the Medusa running the show around here, he approaches them with a stone simulacrum and a big ol’ box of money. “Join me, I have for you an impossible task, etc. etc.”. Now, as a DM of a group of questionably good characters, I’m thinking, “There’s no way they’ll take this offer! They’ve got plenty of money anyway! Plus they want to blow up Namek, and kill the NPC’s wife!” Ooooh boy. Boy I was not ready for what came next.

The Cleric, our coward, immediately signs up. The Rogue, our opportunist, takes up the offer once money and promise of a magic item is involved. Our naive little Druid is more than willing to “return to the earth” some stuff, and our Himbo Barbarian goes along after the pot is sweetened with the freedom of the NPC’s wife, and the sparing of some strategic lives. The only one to decline? Our Wizard. He’d dealt with cults before, and they nearly took his life on too many occasions. Plus, he already possessed encyclopedic knowledge by this time, and practically all he really needed. No Medusa was about to persuade him to bend. 

The four of them got brought into his office for some debriefing on their suicide mission. The Wizard, the NPC, and their hobgoblin buddies got thrown in with the Black Geode, the portal to the Plane of Earth, for about 8 seconds, before the party negotiated the Wizard’s life. They are friends after all. So the party, the NPC and his hopefully living wife, get shunted up to the surface with a new mission: Go get the devastation orb of earth that the nearby canyon town stole, by any means necessary. Head to the Temple of Howling Hatred, and beat up the Air Cult. Come back, get paid. Hard for some Earth Cultists, but maybe not for some player characters. 

Players were pretty sad about calling it after that. I’ve noticed when you play with a group for a while, you have your good and your mediocre sessions. Most games, you reach a point in the night where you’re happy to call it a night and go home, it’s late and the food coma starts to set in. This was not one of those nights. They would have gladly played until the crack of dawn if I’d let them. But I’m a DM, not a miracle worker. I’ve got encounters to build now. 

TL;DR: Party resolves side quests and despite my and the Wizard’s better judgement, join the bad guys. Tense combat encounters, resolution, and a twist had everyone on the edge of their seats. Nobody wanted to go home that night.",dnd
750,Nuke of Annihilation,1,je31gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/je31gf/nuke_of_annihilation/,9,1603147872.0,"(Crossposting from DNDBeyond Forums)  


Hello. My friends and I are going to have a battle royale with the express purpose of having our characters be as rulebreaking as possible. We all get a level 20 character, 20k gold, 1 legendary, 2 v rare, 3 rare, and 4 uncommon magic items.   


The arena is a 250ft radius sphere. Would the following tactic function?  


Level 20 wizard  
Learn the spells Arcane Gate and Wish  
Use my 1 legendary item for a Ring of 3 Wishes  
Buy a Sphere of Annihilation for 20k gold (The price on the list we're using for buying magical items)  
Get to the center of the battlefield and cast Arcane Gate to the very edge of it. Wait for everyone else to get within 180 feet of the center. Put the sphere of annihilation in the center. Go through the gate and then bring the sphere with.  


When a SoA passes through a portal of some sort, you roll to see what happens: 1-50, it's destroyed. 51-85, it goes through. 86-100, it teleports itself and everything within a 180 foot radius to the astral plane.  


So, I pass the sphere through. If I roll 1-50, I use wish to undo it. If I roll 51-85, I put it back through and use wish if that also fucks up. If I roll 86-100 while in the center, it nukes everything and wins me the game. With 4 casts of Wish, this should leave me with a relatively high chance to win.  


Is this a winning, workable tactic? Is there any better way to create a nuke of the same sort?  


Other tactics that may work:  
Use a Bag of Holding plus Mage Hand instead of the Arcane Gate in order to trigger the nuke.  
Have a hireling (Yes, for some dumbass reason we're allowed to bring hirelings) teleported to the center and have him use a bag of holding while I sit comfortably and just wish away his bad rolls.",dnd

You see, long story short i based a chapter of my campaign on ""masquerada songs and shadows"" game. There are masks that enable element control to the owner, venetian style intrigues with the people of the city fighting with the nobility etc. Etc. My players are getting close to the end of that chapter, and at the end of it they are going to fight the cesare of the city, whose mask have not only the ability to create a new masks from the sacrificed people ( not that big of a deal in a fight) but also let's him control all elements ( big deal in a fight). 


I've been thinking how to make him and would ask for you advice. (5, 4 lvl pc, mostly all have weapon +1)


Hp: 168 (they brought down larger oponents).

Ac: 16.

Movement 30 feet.

Main mechanics is gonna be that at the start of his turn he is going to change the element he is controlling depending on a d4 roll.

1 air - doubles his speed and lets him do an extra attack.

2 - earth gives him +2 to Ac.

3 - fire returns half the melee damage he takes to the attacker.

4 - water heals him by 2d8.

As for attacks i've thought for a standard multiattack with rapier and some spells up to 3 lvl, of course flavored for the element.
So do you have any sugestions for him as for actions legendary actions( those he needs the most) or spells, or anything at all?

The Ironstar is a dangerous weed-like plant that grows in metal-rich soil, and in some instances solid rock, extracting any traces of iron from the ground as nutrients.

The plant forms 2” iron spikes, protruding from the soil, surrounded by thin, metallic, wirelike roots.

Its root system is a web of intricate patterns that spreads several feet in all directions, where it forms new spikes, and a new web of roots spreading from these new spikes.

While it is commonly known as the Ironstar plant, it also goes by “Sparkflowers”

The plant gets its name from its behavior during intense lightning storms. Under the right storm conditions, the iron spikes open up, forming a star-like shape. These flowers are statically charged and have sparks shooting from them every few seconds. They attract lightning like moths to a flame.

The weed can be dangerous, as the protruding spikes act like caltrops and can cause serious injury when stepped on. The real danger however is after a lightning storm. The network of roots and spikes stores up some of the electric charges. Touching any of the webbed roots without proper insulation can be fatal. It can take up to 6 weeks for the electric charge from the storm to seep back into the soil.

This makes it a troublesome weed, as entire swathes of land covered in these roots become untraversable for weeks after a proper storm. It is also difficult to remove this root, as conventional farming tools aren’t strong enough to sever the strands.

It’s still not known how the plant spreads to new regions, as it doesn’t have a discernible seed. It is speculated that the plant is a fungus and that it spreads via spores.

People have come up with some interesting uses for the Sparkflowers.

Some cultures harvest the unelectrified Ironstars to be melted down for their metal content.

There are instances like the Halfari Elves that take the processing of the Ironstars a step further. They learned how to insulate themselves when working with the Sparkflowers. This has led to them harvesting the lighting charged spikes and encasing them in sword hilts. The hilt is then placed in a sword-shaped mold filled with iron pellets. It takes a few years, but the webbed roots eventually fill up the entire mold, creating a solid metal sword that is grown instead of forged. As long as the sword is kept insulated when stored, and is kept from prolonged exposure to a new source of iron, it will keep its shape and electric charge for a generation or two.

I'm relatively new to dnd and I'm a little unsure of the definitions of each allignment.

I'm creating a cleric of light domain and my idea is to have him be an outwardly calm, fatherly and charismatic missionary. However, in truth he is a manipulative, unhinged zealot who despises monsters and heretics and seeks only to purge the world of their existence and though he'd never admit it, he takes great joy in seeing heretics and abominations burn for their sins, believing that only the purifying power of the flame can bring them their salvation.

For those of you who are familiar, my character is based on Mozgus from Berserk.

I was just wondering what allignment this might fall under? I think maybe lawful evil, although his goal is merely to purify the world and he's convinced that what he's doing is good so maybe chaotic good?

Ranger Reworks are almost a dime a dozen but I thought I would take a swing at creating a class I feel best encapsulates what a Ranger should be. I have drawn from other peoples' work including the offical WotC no magic ranger for Class feature ideas (i.e Poulstices). As I do not want to pass off other peoples' ideas as entirely my own.

I feel the Ranger should be represented as a Martial class with access to magical abilities such as Haste through a mechanic I have called ""focus"". I have created ""focus"" which draws from aspects of other classes to create what I hope is a unique flavourful way that makes the Ranger satisfying in a way other Classes cannot provide.

The Ranger uses their knowledge, powers of deduction and determination of will to perform remarkable feats. In the chaos of battle they remain calm and undetered from their foe and use quickly identify ways in which they can exploit their weaknesses. In essence they are the polar opposite of a Barbarian and their Rage. Or when out in the wilderness they use their vast wealth of knowledge to see what others cannot.

This is definitely what I would call a first draft but complete enough to gauge interest or feedback.

When they arrive the village would look pristine, with a wagon full of cabbage. During the course of the investigation, if they search the village and detect magic. They will find a camp that looks abandoned. Inside a tent is evidence, someone had paid the owners to kill everyone, and plant evidence of a dark cult. 

If they spend the night in the village strange things happen. From furniture moving to things disappearing. If the adventurers try to leave , the village is surrounded by cabbages. (mimic army)

Update after playing:
The players side tracked into the village (insisited on finding their own horses for the trek) they found a small group of donkeys. One player decided to hug it and had an extra 4 in strength, putting it over 20 so I said make a strength check (nat 20). So they strangled a donkey, and another performed animal surgery. 

 After taming the rest of the pack, they made it to the destination. Upon first investigation found no one. They stored the donkeys in an empty stable, and proceeded to search from house to house. First mistake was made, a player took produce to the donkeys for feed. (Cabbages were included)
The player then left the stable and went with the group weapons in hand. Initial investigations provided nothing, but a warlock heard from their patron that a source of magic was close. The group left the village and found a camp cloaked by a magic field. 

They found a letter in the largest tent with wording of killing everyone. Immediately they ran back, they found the donkeys missing. Ironiclly also decided to sleep in the stable. The barbarian got bit by a cabbage in her sleep, which started a sneak attack from cabbages everywhere.  Barbarian rages, everyone else runs, barbarian collapses the stable killing all the cabbages and leaving them severely injured. One player stays to heal the barbarian, the others burn the village.

TLDR down below.

As Baphomet is known as The Horned King and The Prince of Beasts, his stats don't really back up these claims. Especially when you compare them to another huge minotaur-like demon, the Goristro.

Now I don't mean that Baphomet is not a challenge, but because he is more of a melee combat focussed Demonlord I expected him to be a bit more deadly in that department. 
Eventhough Baphomet is a Huge creature all of his melee weapon attacks only have 2 damage dice instead of 3 and his Gore attack only deals 2d6+10 damage, which is insultingly low for a huge 6 horned demonic minotaur (a normal minotaur deals 2d8+4 damage).

Comparing Baphomet to a Goristro seems like a fair comparison in my books. Legendary actions and resistances aside they are in a way the same creature in terms of stature. But then why does a Goristro's Gore attack deal 7d10+7 damage (double that of they charge) and Baphomet only 2d6+10?
A Goristro also has more hit points (310 (23d12+161)) eventhough Baphomet's (275 (19d12+152)) Constitution modifier (26 (+8) compared to the Goristro's 25 (+7)) and Challenge Rating (CR 23 compared to the Goristro's CR 17) are higher, he has the lowest hit points out of all of the Demonlords (next is Zuggtmoy with 304 (32d10+128) who is also CR 23 and only has 18 (+4) constitution)
A Goristro deals  an average of about 63 damage per round with it's multiattack and when charging 83 damage with it's gore attack.
Baphomet on the other hand only deals 57 damage per round with it's multiattack. Kinda seems underwhelming to me even if you add the fact that he can make extra attacks with his legendary actions.

The next dissapointment comes with Baphomet's legendary signature glaive: Heartcleaver. It's just a small hunk of metal. The same as what an Oni wields. The weapon should at least deal the same damage as a glaive wielded by a huge sized creature (which is 3d10 damage) and should maybe have some magical attributes. It's just a very lacking weapon compared to Yeenoghu's flail, the wand of Orcus, Kostchtchie's Matalotok and even Graz'zt's Wave of Sorrow. With such a cool name and being included in almost every description of Baphomet, it should be a unique cool legendary weapon in some way instead of just a smaller than average piece of metal.

When I use him I'll probably homebrew the shit out of him to make him seem more of a challenge and a unique encounter.

TLDR: Baphomet's stats are dissapointing and underwhelming when you compare him to other Demons and he should receive more unique attributes befitting of the Horned King. Also his HP and weapon damage should increase to make him fit the CR 23 a bit more as most level 20 parties will just burst down a creature with 275 HP.",dnd

Or does this simply mean that i can use my default bonus action to activate this effect?

 RAW I can see the latter being the case. On the other hand, it seems kinda weird for it to give me another bonus action just for the sake of triggering this feature. In all other cases, the rules tell you that you can trigger a feature ""once on your turn"", but this one goes as far as to tell you that you have a bonus action for this, so the phrasing is ambiguous.

However, as many creative uses as it has, such as completely nullifying mazes, high-end security systems, revealing hidden rooms, etc, etc;, it just doesn't have as much sticking power as other spells, because most people get stuck thinking about it as a ""travelling overworld spell"" and can't justify it next too Disintegrate, Heroes Feast, contingency etc. 

The spell really just needs a gripping factor, to get players interested in its initial reading w/o throwing off its balance. Therefore I am implementing a small change too it: ""... While you are concentrating on this spell, and are following it's route, you may travel at a Fast Pace without incurring the penalties of a fast pace, and are able to use stealth while doing so."" 

Because these travel limitations have most certainly annoyed players in the past; all this really does is intrigue players to read further into the spells possible uses, which is all this spell really needs to sell itself. The benefits gained by the additions are extremely tiny in the grand scheme of what a player with 6th level spell slots is able to do, and travel by this level is a such a minor factor that it doesn't really throw any balance issues forward.

It works as a normal arm

+1 AC

A place for 1 weapon, for example claws that would give you 1d4 unarmed strikes, or a flamethrower that's basically fire bolt but it recharges on a short rest, or a built in hand crossbow or a built in wand/holy symbol.

A place for 1 tool, basically any tool, for example built in lockpicks.

The arms requirers attunement.

But I feel like it should have some sort of  drawback but I can't really come up with one.

The player can also choose to sacrifice all improvements, but the arm also has no drawbacks.
So it's basically just a normal arm if they choose to do so. In case they don't want to bother.

I intend to buy a magic weapon more interesting than a +1 longsword and I was originally thinking a scimitar of speed would work well as I do not have any real use for my bonus actions after the first round but I found the dancing sword which is also a very rare item.

As a bonus action, the dancing sword can be thrown into the air where it hovers and can fly up to 30ft to make an attack, which it can repeat on using bonus action for 3 subsequent turns, returning to you afterwards. It also states that if you grasp the weapon it ends the dancing effect early.

Therefore would I be able use my attack action holding the sword, then animate the sword as a bonus action have it fly 5ft or so above or beside me and making the attack against whatever is in the square 5ft infront of me then grasp it is my object interaction?

If this does work it effectively allows me to make an extra attack on my bonus action like a scimitar of speed but with a bit more utility due to it's 30ft range. I would be losing out on the +2 bonus the scimitar of speed has but are there any other downsides?

821,Need help making a character.,3,jdyjjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/jdyjjb/need_help_making_a_character/,6,1603128519.0,"I'm kinda new to the game, and I want to make a PC, I've got the basics of the backstory, but I'm unsure on how to do the character itself (class, race, etc.) and I was hoping some of you could help.

The backstory for my character so far:

The character (we'll just call him PC) is a part of a cult, has been for a while. He meets a lady, they start a family in secret, have a daughter, cult finds out. PC & kid get out alive, PC's wife does not. PC takes kid and goes on the run from the cult. Eventually, PC finds home for him and kid, and raises them. Some years later, when kid is old enough to take care of house by herself, PC starts adventuring to get gold to help take care of daughter.

The main problem I'm having is that I don't know what class to make them. I was thinking maybe an Oathbreaker paladin, as they have broken their oath to the god of their cult, but I'm not sure, as I don't want them to be an evil character and the description of an Oathbreaker paladin is very blatantly described as being evil.",dnd

Here's how I had it in my head: They'd kill the 2 bandits guarding the entrance of the house, then they'd go in and kill 3 more bandits, find the secret door in the house, go to an underground cove, kill 5 bandits, kill the bandit captain and save the royal counselor! But here's how it happened: Killed one of the guards, interrogated the last one, killed him, convinced the rest to come out of the house with the hostage and they had 8 bandits and their captain on their mercy, convinced them to release the counselor and arrest the captain. As for the rest of the bandits, they told them to go back in the house, locked the only exit and BURNED THE HOUSE DOWN WITH THE BANDITS INSIDE! The captain saw this on his knees and the party started to dance in front of him as the bard did Vicious Mockery on him and the house burned with the screams of his crew!

The question is as seen above. Issue is, I am playing as a non-paladin who would sometimes do the above.(Actually, how can paladins even do that. My GM says their spells do not need somatics, but according to the list, they do)

I have come up with several ways to do it, but they both got refuted with either ""follow the rules as they are written"" or ""it would be OP"". I could refute either of those, but the more irritating point is when I am told to follow the rules, I do so, and then get told I can't do the thing anyway, and not because it is against the rules.

(Could we please focus on the question instead of downvoting the post because any degree of discord with the DM is heresy to be buried on the bottom of the pile? Thank you)

This is what I came up with. 

Names/race: Nerissa/Water Genasi
Background: Folk hero (but negative, not a positive reputation) people recognize her but it instills fear 


Short story/Intro:
A young boy, damp and wet as a dock rat ducked into the shadow of the stonewalled keep. His straw colored hair was slick with rain, matted against his freckled face.  His eyes darted nervously around as he stuck to the shadows, holding his breath as a group of guardsmen wandered past. He was careful. He shuffled his feet quietly through puddles as to not leave footprints behind in the mud.

From where he stood he could see it. Down the cobbled path into the town square, he saw the massive pyre light the night sky with its amber glow. For once the air was not filled with the gentle lull crashing waves, but the crackle of burning wood.

It was massive pile of wooden statues, carved in the shape of a woman. Their figures blacken, twisted, and curling in the fire. He could see the dark shapes of village fisherfolk moving this way and that way. Milling about and adding to the blaze. Somewhere amongst them, he could hear their Lord’s voice. His Lordship was bellowing curses to those worshipping the She-devil who sprang from the ocean. The boy knew he must be quick. The boy knew the penalty for being caught, meant he would join those wooden women in the flames. 

He hurried to the cliff edge of his tiny village, Lantern Rock. Near the edge of town he found his path. He ran down the twisting spirals of stairs built into the cliff side. Down, down to the black beach below. The steps were wooden, swollen and slick from years of rain, but the boy knew his way. Soon his feet touched the wet sand and he darted farther down the beach. His path lit only by the light of the moon. 

It was not long before he found her cove. Almost hidden in the rock and shielded by a never ending spray of the crashing waves nearby. At its mouth, there was another wooden statue of a woman. Just like those he’d seen in the pyre. From where he stood  he could see her features were sharp, angular but beautiful. The rain ran In rivulets down her face and cloaked frame. Her long, elegant fingers peaked out from the folds of the cloak: one clasping a lantern and the other held a skull.

The Maiden of the Mist. Cautiously he approached the mouth of the cave, while his tiny heart hammered in his chest. 

But before he could enter, a voice called out. 

""Dear Geralt, sweet boy..."" the woman's voice crooned softly from within the dark of the cave ""I know why you've come to see me...what is it that you bring?""

Geralt hesitated, the voice was soothing but somehow he could not stop his legs shaking. How did she know his name? ""Mama is sick,"" he whimpered ""I wondered if you could help her...Miss."" he squeaked.

""Of course, my sweet, but again I ask...what did you bring for me...?"" her whisper felt like a hand had reached out and stroked his cheek. His body relaxed, but his heart continued to hammer.

""I brought you a s-secret.” he stammered ""Lord Pyke's wife, Lady Elenor. She is with child, miss. They say...they say it’s going to be a girl.”

Though Geralt could not see her, he felt her stiffen at the mention of his Lord. He could feel her rage, seething in the shadows. There was a long silence before she answered ""How did you come by this secret, my boy...” she paused before recalling “Ah, yes. You are Lord and Lady Pyke's cupbearer, are you not?"" 

Shaking even more violently now, he could only muster a nod. He feared if he opened his mouth, she would only hear his chattering teeth.

It was then that The Maid of the Mist stepped from the shadows. She was tall and ethereal like a goddess, her light green skin shining with sea water and flecked with black sand. Around her shoulders she had draped seaweed in a makeshift cloak and about her torso she tied a fishermen's net in a handmade tunic. Her hair was long and dark blue, eerily floating in a thousand tiny braids about her head. Her face every bit as beautiful as a meraid, but her aura every bit a siren. 

She smiled, to reveal her pointed teeth. Geralt felt as though he might cry. ""Young Geralt, sweet Geralt...lurking and listening in the shadows..."" She tutted, a spear resting in her hands.  ""Naughty, naughty. This delicious secret you've brought me...” she inhaled sharply, almost purring with delight “...is more than enough payment.""

The boy exhaled a sigh of relief as The Maid continued ""Tell no one that we met. Bring your mother to the beach. I will heal her of her ailments. Run along now, my sweet."" With that she leaned down and kissed his forehead. A shock of cold ran through him. Cold and bracing as being cast overboard into the Sea. Shivering he turned and took off running into the night, terrified and exhilerated. He had earned a favor from Lady Nerissa! The Maiden!

Her eyes watched Geralt hurry down the beach back toward's Lantern Rock. She glared at the piercing light in the dark that was Lantern's Tower. That place that was her prison for so many years. 

""Tidus, come here..."" Nerissa beckoned her companion.  

From the shadows, an amalgamation of arms crept forward. 

Tidus, her fiery red octopus, shambled quickly towards his mistress. His tentacles gripped the back of her seaweed cloak and climbed up to settle comfortably on her shoulder. His yellow eyes looked up expectantly.  

“It’s time to pay Lord Pyke a visit...” she purred. “Congratulations are in order. We have a little sister on the way.” Her lips curled back into a piranha’s smile.

Background:
Lantern's Rock is a small port town on a rocky black coast. Settled on a cliffside crest above a treacherous sea cove, Lantern's Rock is meant to guide ships to safety. It’s cove is dangerous to the uninitiated. Riddled with hidden coral reefs. In the past, these were used as a deterrent for intruders. The town is rumored to be an old pirate port that went down the straight and narrow. Choosing to deal in the bounty of the sea in recent years, instead of stealing bounty from others. Now a fisherfolk village, that can never escape the damp spray of the ocean. It is a light in the dark for most ships in passing, and nothing more. A hard place that makes hard and superstitious people. Lorded over by the Lord Captain Arnold Pyke. 

Born in this Port town, Nerissa was different and shunned the moment she came into this realm a squalling babe. Her mother was the red haired Lady Isla. Heralded by the fisherfolk as a healer, while some called her a witch for her abilities and beauty. Wife to the Lord Captain Pyke, but Nerissa was not his daughter. 

The day Nerissa was born, Her green palish skin was proof enough of Lady Isla's infidelity. Genie blood does not hide. An unforgiving man, Lord Pyke locked them both in the Lantern Tower of his keep over looking the sea for years. Ashamed of his wife and her bastard. 

Nerissa remembers that little room they shared at the top of their tower. The beaming light of their home guiding fishermen home and the call of the ocean through their single window. Even as a young child, she could hear it crooning to her like a lullaby she couldn’t quite understand. She remembered the mist on her face as the waves crashed against the seaside cliffs that held up their tiny town. 

She discovered early on her abilities as a genasi and her mother tried to keep them hidden. Insisting that Nerissa's green skin and blue hair were all she had inherited from her Father. Lord Pyke was not convinced, and one night took Lady Isla away. 

On that stormy night, Nerissa awoke to find her mother gone. Through the window, she saw Lady Isla was placed on a sciff. Soon she disappeared over the horizon. Nerissa watched, hoping her boat would come back. It never did. She awoke the next morning to not her mother, but Lord Pyke at her door.

His stare was a cold one. ""Some folk say you are touched by the Gods. Some folk say you are cursed. But either way, harming you would bring ill omen."" Nerissa said nothing and there was a long, heavy silence between the two of them. But she could feel his anger boiling beneath the surface.

""Do you know what your name means, girl?"" he spat. ""It means 'from the sea'...that's what you are, no daughter of mine. But like all that comes from the Sea, I will make use of you. Or Gods be damned, I will return you to the Sea.""

Soon after, Lord Pyke took a second wife Lady Elenor from the mainland. A frivilous, prideful, and pious woman. Who immediately took a disliking young Nerissa. “I cannot fathom why my Lord husband would keep such a demon about his Keep,"" she would hiss. ""But it is not a woman's place to question her husband. May God or the Sea take her soon."" She was stupid and vain, thought Nerissa, nothing like Mother.

From then on Nerissa worked as the common fisherfolk did and she was no longer welcome at Pyke's Keep.  Treated as an other by the town, she was isolated and spat at in passing. With her Lord treating her as the village scapegoat whenever a ship was lost or some other hardship befell his people. Some were kind when they could be, but most feared the wrath of Lord Pyke.  The town acted with the same disgust or at best, pretended she did not exist.

She spent her most of her time silently working on the docks. Hoisting, mending, and building  
boats. Standing on the pier and watching them go over that horizon as her mother once did.
Some came back...others didn't...soon she was making voyages to trade on the boats she had built. Her Lord secretly hoping she would one day disappear. She considered leaving again and again, but if mother returned to Lantern Rock how would she find Nerissa? And so she stayed.

It was on one of these short voyages that she met Drake. A reliable fisherman, who showed Nerissa kindness in any way he could. Offering her lodging and food at first. She suspiciously refused. So, he began simply offering her his company. He spent many nights speaking with Nerissa in a hidden cave beneath the town. Its entrance cloaked in the mist of the waves that crashed against the cliffside. She never entertained more and treated their conversation gruffly at times. Though Drake seemed not to mind her harshness. She never told him she was always sad to see him leave.

On one seafaring journey, their ship was marooned by a storm that gave no warning. It appeared seemingly from nowhere and smashed their vessel against the rocks of a small island.

Strange to be sure, but the stranger thing was...there were no animals on the island. Not even birds dared to rest there.

Their crew had tried fishing for sustenance, but try as they might they caught nothing. Without food or water, the crew perished leaving only Nerissa and Drake.The Sea provided for her. 
She could go days without food or water, but not him. He was wasting away with each passing hour. It was strange, Drake wondered,  why were there no fish? Nerissa felt something beneath the waves, but said nothing. There is something there, she thought. Something too large to be caught...

Lantern Rock was too far a swim for her to bring Drake. If she swam with him, he would drown. If she did nothing, one of the few people who had shown her kindness perish. Perhaps it was alright if they were together... 

Frustrated and tired, Nerissa lay in the sand and wondered what to do. She considered what would happen if she were to return herself to the Sea.  

She was not sure if she could watch Drake die.

..and so she walked into the waves and embraced Oblivion. 

The roar of the waves turned to crushing silence. She thought she had died. Sea water filled her lungs, and she was swallowed up by the darkness. She thought she had perished and would soon see her mother again...But instead a voice spoke.

""RISE CHILD...” The voice whispered to her. Soft, chilling, familiar. ""RISE AND LET THE WORLD FEEL YOUR WRATH."" The voice felt ancient and powerful, resonating from the deep. 

She awoke on the beach to the sound of waves lapping at the beaches of her isolated island...and the sound of feet, shuffling through the sand. The rotting corpse of the ship’s Captain stumbled by her, clutching his bone-y fingers towards the ship. But he was not the only one.

Did her eyes deceive her? She had raised her dead crewmates in her sleep and now their rotted bodies staggered to repair the ship.

Among her dead servants, Drake's body stumbled to get to work as well. He had died in the night, while she slept. Once again, Nerissa had awoken to another nightmare.

They returned in the dead of night on the Ghost Ship of her making. The town stood on the docks waiting and the dead were returned to their families to be buried. Men stood agape, women gasped and clutched their children. Watching Nerissa's ragged figure step off a boat with a skeleton crew. Unconcerned with their stares, she wandered down the beach to be alone. Nerissa skulked off to the black sand beaches to wallow in her grief. Not a soul spoke a word to her.

It made no difference to Lord Pyke, as long as his ship returned he needed no details on how and he cared not for Nerissa's whereabouts. But his wife was heard screeching in the keep of demons and ghosts.

Nerissa was not sure when it started, but soon after some fisherfolk from the village began leaving her offerings. Trinkets and money left on the sand for her to find. Attached was always a note.
 
A curse...
A wish...
A plea...
A name...
A request...


Most were in some variation, a request to find someone or something at Sea. Suddenly she had something they wanted. In her nights swimming the cove --hoping to hear the voice again--She would bring them back in the night. Dead or alive. Folk paid her well and the offerings continued. Sometimes she would bring back more than what was requested. More Undead to serve her well and steer her soon to be ship. 

Sometimes, she demanded more than money. Lord Pyke 's fury would great were he to ever find out. WHEN he found out...he had no doubt heard the fisherfolk whispering about The Maid of the Mist. The Maid who brought back what was lost to all but herself. She hoped he was afraid, because her powers were growing...

She had no need for money, but took it because it was expected. Soon she dealt in things more precious than money....secrets....power...life itself...it was the Sea calling, providing her with some sense...some energy... pulsing beneath the waves. Using her newfound popularity amongst the fisherfolk, she began deliberately trading secrets and making pacts in exchange for her services...gathering what she could to undermine those who had wronged her.

It was soon that the support of the Town became overwhelming. They began placing altars in the town square, carving her image into the bow of ships, selling trinkets of black sand claiming to be blessed by the Maiden of the Mist. ""Take this on your next voyage, folks! May she lead you Home or to The Place Beyond the Horizon!"" the sellers cried in the streets.

At this point Lord Pyke had had enough. The fact that Lady Ilsa's bastard still lived was insult enough, but having her image paraded around his town and worshipped was an egregious insult. He gathered all the trinkets and altars, placing them in a pyre in front of his keep. He proclaimed the late Lady Ilsa a witch, and her daughter the same. That Nerissa lured his townsfolk to worship her with unnatural gifts. He declared her a blight upon Lantern Rock, a sea hag to be burned at the stake. Any who opposed his ruling on the matter, would burn with her. And so he lit the pyre and his word was law. 

Angry, Nerissa retaliated. She snuck into the Keep to find Lord Pyke and put an end to his life. But the Lord was not home, only his pious wife. 

It was then she had an idea.

In the flickering shadows of the candlelit Pyke Hall, Lady Elenor ate her supper. Elenor did not feel Nerissa’s presence silently moving toward her in the dark. It was not until Nerissa was beside her, almost able to reach out and touch her swollen belly did she notice.

“Imposter...liar...what else shall I call you, my lady? Certainly not ‘mother’...” Nerissa’s voice purred into Elenor’s ear as she gripped the back of her chair firmly, pinning her in place against the table. Her voice was whisper, but there was venom dripping from her words. “And yet, here you sit in Lady Isla’s place...a woman of your standing has everything your heart could desire. And so I am curious, Lady Elenor...” With an unearthly strength Nerissa gripped the chair and spun a terrified Elenor to face her “...what is it that you want most in this world?”

The question seemed to startle Elenor, she felt off balance in this careful dance of words and so she scrambled to keep her footing. This intruder entered her home only to ask her a question? Furious, Elenor made her move. Proud and prideful as ever, Elenor chose to steady herself. She raised her chin defiantly and she spat on stone floor. “I want nothing. Only for you to be gone from my keep and lands, witch.” Elenor hissed, leaning as far away from Nerissa as she could. Trapped by her chair and her captors grip, Elenor was repulsed by their proximity to one another.

What happened next was odd. Nerissa began to laugh. 

Throwing her head back, she cackled loudly. A vicious, mocking sound that echoed off the walls of the empty hall. A laugh that was high and thin like the edge of a knife, cutting through Elenor. Lady Pyke hated it. It make her feel as though she was apart of some cruel jest made at her expense. Elenor bristled, opening her mouth again to demand she leave.

It was then that Nerissa whipped her head forward, her face so close to Elenor’s their noses touched. Trapped in this intimate embrace, Lady Elenor squirmed backward in her chair frantically as Nerissa reached up to trace the shape of Lady Pyke’s face. 

“Who am I to deny you, my lady? I am but a servant.  Your wish is granted.” Nerissa’s green lips peeled back into a pointed smile, the light in her blue eyes dancing with mischievous delight. “But be warned, my lady... there is a cost.” 

Now impatient, Lady Elenor snapped “Take what you want and leave! I have no time for your games!” 

""Your wish is my command."" Nerissa answered, gently raking her nails across the curve of Elenor's belly before taking her leave.


As Nerissa disappeared into the night Elenor felt a wetness pooling in her underclothes. A sensation she recognized. Blood. Something was terribly wrong.

With the death of Lord Pyke’s heir, Nerissa sailed toward the horizon. The price had been paid and she intended to keep her promise. She was leaving. Where was she headed? She did not know. All she knew was she could feel the Sea calling to her louder than ever before...and It was exhilarating.",dnd
836,Some memorable NPC's,2,jdwwxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/jdwwxu/some_memorable_npcs/,0,1603119463.0,"So I have many memorable NPC's and I'd like to share a few. Feel free to steal them and edit them how you see fit. I have but one condition, let me know how it goes.

The Swift triplets. So there are 3 identical Tabaxi who are triplets. They look identical, sound identical, and their names are Swift, Swifter, Swiftest. Swift is a conman and a thief.

Swifter is the same but worse. He will attempt to sell the party a magical broom that can sweep people into other dimensions called the Swifter Sweeper, but don't blame him if it doesn't work it takes a month to attuned to. Thought it's still worth all the 10,000 gold he charges for it, and it's just a regular broom with handle covered in a paper-thin sheet of gold.

Swiftest is a cleric who has dedicated his life to healing and works in a hospital. He is kind and polite offering every courtesy possible.

Swift and Swifter both talk about how much worse their brother is and how terrible of a person he is so it's hilarious when the party finally meets him expecting a thief and conman but gets the most wholesome NPC ever.

For the voice, I basically asked myself what would M'aiq the liar sound like if he were on speed?


Swift and Swifter talk about how great their parents are while Swiftest tells you stories about how they robbed people of everything. He also tells you stories like: ""One time my brothers brought a injured dragonborn veteran into the City Square and begged people to donate money so he could pay a healer to heal his limp. But it wasn't a dragonborn it was three kobolds in a trenchcoat. A gust of wind blew off the trenchcoat and my brothers we're gone before it hit the ground"". Swift and Swifter will also pretend to be Swiftest.


Now your players will probably want to kill Swift and Swiftest, so don't be afraid to have them brag about being part of the thieves guild and owning the guards to dissuade any murderhoboing. I'll put up some more of these eventually and enjoy driving your players mad with these brothers. Though don't be an asshole then no one has fun.


Edit: I had Swift and Swifter run their own shops and sell goods which you knew were stolen. They would also sell everything at like double the price. So they are at their shops most of the time but every once in a while they venture out usually to meet up with their parents, do a job for the thieves guild, or screw with Swiftest. Having them pop up all the time will annoy the hell out of the party. That said the party fighting them is more than possible.

Basically I've been thinking and realized that Kobolds have a very different social and biological structure than other humanoids.

 Humans irl have a long history of having strict differences between male and female in terms of social norms and assumptions. We also tend to have self-oriented ways of thinking, most people only actively helping themselves or those in their direct ""family"". Kobolds on the other hand think only for the entire tribe, so pretty much the opposite of humans. This kinda led me to think that using detailed pronouns for individual Kobolds besides just ""kobold"" doesn't make sense in this context. The identity of a kobold lies in its tribe, not within themself.


Most other playable races have a clear physical distinction between sexes as they are basically human anatomically speaking. Kobolds are not. There is no apparent difference between kobold sexes aside from sex organs, and even those don't remain constant as Kobolds literally transform their genitalia based on the tribe's needs.",dnd

I could make out who he was, but he seemed to have Goblin feature and, just as i was going to get close, i woke up without knowing his identidy; screams of discussion woke all the group up, by the shouts it seemed that Allerio scared Chraonar by being disguised as a Gnoll, eventually making everyone start joining the fight.

I shouted at them to be quiet as some of us tried to sleep and, with the help of Kaicias, they stopped discussing, continuing their shifts; i wasnt able to return to that dream, but was able to get a long rest from the battle with the Ankheg that almost burn my beautiful body.

We woke up early in the morning, eating some rations as well as sharing with our mules: John Legs, aka, ""Jegs"", Frankie, Johnny and Louie; was our preparations were ready, we headed straight to the town of Arbor, excited to have finished our job and be able to rest for a while.

Carl started discussing our situation and how we were ""involved"" on the assassination of the noble in Haran, all in the presence of Marcus; Chraonar started to squeeze Carl´s shoulder, trying to make him be quiet, but Marcus had luckily had heard enough, yet, thanks to Carl´s surprising Good persuasión, Marcus decided to not say nothing about it as we did help him out alot.

We eventually arrived at Arbor, very late at the afternoon, yet, there were people still at the street, many walking into Ulric´s tavern; i told Carl to assist me into persuaing people to coming to the inn, eating the manticore´s meat as well as boosting our fame, but, unfortunately, alongside Allerio, they ended up scaring the people as they pretend to be a Manticore Mascot as well as a Paladin.

Marcus decided to go home as we decided to take the body of Jacob Lycan to the temple, leaving behind the ""performance"" of Allerio and Carl at the street; we were able to bring the body, giving it so the proper burial preparations could be made. Arenstein was also there, having finishing the health potions and gifting us with half a dozen more of them as Kaicias had requested; we said our goodbyes and headed straight to Marcus´ house as Kaicias was worry about him.

We started hearing a heated discussion, making Kaicias knock on the door where it seemed that Marcus, even though he had returned to his grandmother and sister, was already thinking on going to Shamal Falls to go tell Jacob´s parents about his death; Kaicias and Brunar tried to calm down the situation, making Marcus´ actions, even if reckless, honorable, going so far as saying that they may assist him into going there with protection if the Embassador allowed us.

After hearing that, the grandmother was a bit calmed, even telling us that the Embassador was back and waiting for us at the inn; with no more to say, we headed to the inn, passing to town hall to leave our mule companions but there was nobody to accept them so we took them to the inn.

As soon as we open the door to the inn, the people that was talking and drinking, stop in complete silence, looking at our arrival; i took the opportunity to boost our fame, opening the door the widest i could to show the bodies of the 2 dead manticores. The people started to smile and laugh in joy, celebrating and calling as héroes.

Everybody was enjoying the prays of the people, i went a little far and boosted the ""Veracious Manticore Delicacy"" even though many where already eating it; i felt something in my pocket, as it appeared from nowhere. I started touching to see what it felt like, realizing it was a piece of paper and, as i opened it, it seemed a message from the Embassador, waiting for us in his room.

I headed the fastest i could, spotting Carl with the Embassador, showing his staff at him; i looked at him, questioning if he did the same thing to the Embassador as he did to Arenstein, but he denied it, hiding it away. I didnt care what he would do with it, just told him to be careful and stood leaning to the wall while we waited for the rest of the group.

Once everyone was in the room, the Embassador thanked us for our job in helping the town but did mention the little trouble that Carl and I did, yet, even if i decided to take the whole blame, he wasnt angry, just said that the next time we shouldnt be careful and not get caught; after those words, he gave us our next misión: going to Kiriath and stealing a book for him from a Magic Academy.

Carl seemed excited, wanting to know everything about it, but the Embassador told him that those answers would be revealed when the time is right; i did point out that we had promised Marcus to escort him to Shamal Falls if he was okay with it where he said that we had to make a quick stop there so he would first talk to Marcus´ grandmother to get her approved.

Once all was discussed, he decided to give us our reward money for the job we did, but Carl and I told we have accepted not to receive our part as an agreement with the Town Counselor so he gave it to Kaicias and told us to be prepared as we were leaving early on the morning, around 10am; everyone went away with the exception of Chraonar, Kaicias and I.

Kaicias wished to speak a few more words with the Embassador, telling Chraonar and me that he wished to do it privately; i nodded to him, telling to ask about our paperwork that the Embassador had promised. He said he would talk about it, making me leave the room after saying goodbye to everyone as i went to my room; knowing that tomorrow we had a journey ahead, i started thinking in the possibilities, looking for ways to help our new goal.""

Your Adventure Begins…
Darkness, the familiar emptiness of the void grants comfort and puts ease to your soul as the sounds of that around lull you to drowsiness. You feel weakened, sore as you are hunched over, slightly rocking to the sound of hooves clopping and clasping against a stone path, the whicker of horses casually breaking through the rustling of pine and fir trees. Happily chirping birds sing the songs of seasons past, the tenuous drip of a nearby creek providing a backdrop to the world desperately being painted within your mind. The air has a tender chill, the hallmark of encroaching winter but no more bothersome that the weave clothing caressing your body, shoddy and loose tendrils of twine scratching against your sides. You move to try and alleviate the irritation but are stopped by the bindings that join your wrists. Aged wood tells the tale of countless travels, creaks and groans, shifting and straining beneath you. The clamor of plated wheels rises and falls to each trod of ground, with every pit and pebble pressured to give in or way to the ongoing journey. The smell of frostbitten nature twirls within your nostrils, trimming the hairs with sweet pine and sweat treading to seal the memory behind. You mind drifts to happier times. Timid nights made comfortable from the aging of a roaring fire. Close conversation, affirmation of meaning and affection to loved ones. A full bottle of mead and roast close at hand, the fullness of one’s belly, beer, bread, or bountiful laughter signifying a hard day’s work. The soft caress of a lover, passion’s exuberance swelling to the brim of the mind, releasing splendor and amorous exhilaration before the splitting of dawn’s light through the window, the assurance of compassion’s warmth waking and waning one to and from deep slumber. The illusion is broken. You struggle, hesitant to open your eyes and confront whatever reality awaits beyond your dream. Your eyes desperately try to shield themselves behind eyelids, but as with all things this proves futile in the end. The world cuts and gnaws away at the edges, slowly bleeding in. Everything around blurs into one image, a conglomerate of lights and colors before dancing into form, coalescing into shapes, erecting into images, and finally revealing the instance of life you’ve come to inhabit. The world is gray, stale in the attempt to showcase the majesty of creation. Murk and mire drip from the treetops, clothing the area of white, green, and stony drab that are present in a miasmic sheath of fog. The fullness of breath struggles to break the humidity, moistened cold halting the progress of air until finally is broken and returned to your lungs. The aches within your neck release their hold allowing you raise your visage to what lies before you.
From what you can tell, a man sits before you, part of an unfortunate cobble of individuals you managed to be bound with. He is sturdily built, as most are from region to what you know and have heard. The sculpted nature of his body is accented by the chain and quilted tunic overlain by a cobalt cloth, blonde hair adorned with the frost and dirt of the surrounding area, a single braid piercing from his features on the left side of his face. The grizzled nature of his chin marks him as some aged fellow, an individual who’s found comfort in the weathering of his life overtime. As if sensing your analysis of his person, the individual turns to you, his emerald-like eyes weighted by bags from troubling, sleepless nights. He speaks to you, a gruff yet tender and friendly tone.

I have a main campaign that I’m apart of, but recently my friend has started a new campaign.
We’ve had 5 sessions. The problem is, he has home brewed a huge amount of things along the way.
I asked him if we were going to do a session zero, and he said “why?”, and I said to make sure everything is sorted out and we know what we are getting into. Almost nothing was said.

Now here is a listen of things he has home brewed in the middle of sessions.
1. He has made taking potions a bonus action (he was going to make it a FREE action but I pleaded with him not to.)
2. He has made attacks not hit when it means the AC.
3. ANY 1s you role on damage dice you reroll.
4. He has nerfed the evade ability (which we have a monk and rogue in our party) to still take damage on a succeed.
5. He allowed the mystic class.
6. Sometimes whenever something doesn’t go exactly like he planned it, he will change the rules for that one scenario. (Character when down, made 3 successful saving throws. Instead of him being stabilized, he brought him back to life with 1 hit point because he wanted him back in the fight. He did not roll a natural 20.)

Here are some other grievances I have.

Magic item distribution: 
The party looted this mansion, and in the treasure, there was a magic item for each of us.
Each item was clear that for which member the item was supposed to go to. Gloves for monk, grappling hook for rogue, staff for warlock. However, our tank, a fighter (who happens to be the DMs best friend), received a homebrew legendary item (Phoenix armor, if you want to see a broken item). The gloves for the monk were uncommon items, and the tank receives a ridiculous powerful homebrew item (did I mention we are only level 6 at this time?).


Will openly go against the book: I will say, I’m a rule follower. I try to follow the rules to the T. But There have been sometimes the DM has said something happens, which is explicitly against the rules. I understand DM has final say and all, but that should be reserved for sticky situations that aren’t completely clear, not saying that I don’t have advantage anymore because they saw my Eldritch blast when I have greater invisibility active.

Disregards criticism/little input from players: There have been a few times players have felt stepped on.
I am good friends with the DM, and I am at his house often. I was there once while he was writing the next session. He asked me “What is a good god of death?”
I gave him some suggestions and asked, “why?”
“Oh, I am writing stuff for when you go see *monk player*’s monastery.”
I go, “oh okay, but I’m pretty sure *monk player* isn’t religious or spiritual... so I don’t know that you should impede on that...”
The DM shrugs. That session we were introduced to the monastery which now has a goddess patron against the original ideas of the Monk’s.

Also, there have been plot holes at the detriment to the players, and players have noticed them, simply because it would be bad for us to have them, and the DM interrupts and speeds past, not even acknowledging it.

He doesn’t plan ahead. Every single session we’ve had, I’ve gotten to his house and he is on his laptop writing the session.
In fact, last time, we started 2 hours late because he wasn’t prepared.

So my question is, what do I do?
Do I take a list of complaints to him, or do I just leave the campaign?
If the winner is the second one, how do I go about saying I’m going to leave, considering he is such a close friend?
Thanks for reading this, I appreciate you.",dnd

I really love the idea of magic being fluid and malleable; obviously you can design your own spells, or else how did Mordenkainen and Bigby get theirs? But how to do it is the key.

I'm thinking it would actually be different for each spellcasting class, like the Magic Initiate feat is. Here's what I'm thinking for the Wizard:

\-------

Spellcrafter (Wizard):

Prerequisite: Intelligence of 16 or higher.

You have begun to understand magic in such a deep way that you can bend and shape it to your will, gaining the following benefits:

You can craft a new spell of your own design. This takes work and practice, amounting to one week of undistracted (though not necessarily consecutive) study for every level of the spell. The components are also expensive, requiring 1,000gp per level of the spell. You cannot design a spell of a level higher than you can cast.

Designating which level a spell belongs to is not an exact science, and your GM has final veto power (but must exercise this power before the character undertakes the process of designing the spell). This works best if the PC bases the level of the spell off of an existing spell that has a similar nature to the spell being deisgned.

I'm thinking something like this! I was also thinking that maybe Spellcrafter (Sorcerer) would be similar, but with lower temporal and financial costs, but every time the sorcerer casts the spell they design, there's a chance that the spell backfires and explodes, harming them. That DC would go down every time they successfully cast it until they've 'got it down.' 

I'm not exactly sure how I would do this for Warlocks since they get their magic in such a different way, though I imagine the feat for Clerics would be similar, since Clerics and Warlocks both get their magic from a patron. Druids might be similar to sorcerers, though they're kind of an in-between spot between sorcerers and wizards.

Another thing I'm not sure how to handle would be spells that scale as you level. Like, could you make a spell that shoots a laser beam or whatever, make it as a level 1 spell, and then cast it at level 5? Would you have to ""re-make"" it for every higher level or something? I'm not sure about that.

But yeah! What do you all think? Any glaring unsolvable problems you see in my idea? Any constructive or helpful suggestions?",dnd

My question is: *With all of the supplements for 5E that introduce new mechanics and elements, what do I need to research in order to avoid retrodding old ground?*  I have already read the three core books cover to cover.

Starting with Warts giving you -2 Charisma modifier and disadvantage on Charisma checks, if you had advantage on Charisma checks it becomes neutral. Unless Warts aren't showing or you use intimidation.

Then you get stronger legs, so you can use a standing leap and gain advantage on any str or dex checks that involve your legs. Along with becoming immune to poison and resistant to disease.

Then you gain the ability to pull a target from 10ft away while using your tounge this is a grapple and counts as a bonus action. On a grapple you can now swallow the target if they are smaller than you as an action or of the same size with creature for a strength check with disadvantage. Once swallowed they take scaling acid damage and can attack with sharp weapons with disadvantage, along with them being blinded, restrained and deafened but unable to be targeted even by AoE. (normal Giant Frog/Toad swallow rules here)
Smaller creatures reduce your movement by 5 feet while same size creatures reduce it by 10 feet. You also gain disadvantage for Dex saves.
You can choose to spit them out at any time as a action. If the target dies inside you, you can either spit them out or choose to digest them as a free meal while spitting out anything indegestible once they are digested. While they are digesting they will still grant the reduced movement speed and disadvantage on Dex saves. Digestion time also increases as your acid damage scales up.
Only one creature can be swallowed at a time.
You also become immune to acid damage.

[cb]<{----------[0]----------}>

You gain a free cast of find familiar. That Familiar will always be a Frog or a Toad.

You gain a free cast of Conjure animals. Roll a D6. If it is 1-2 then Summon 8 Frogs or Toads.
If it is 3-4 then summon 4 Giant Frogs.
If it is 5-6 then Summon 2 Giant Toads.
In addition any cast of Conjure animals will only be able to go off of this tree, but the effect of using a more powerful spell slot still applies.
At higher levels gain extra free casts of Conjure Animals and remove summoning normal Frogs and Toads.
Even later on using it will give you a choice of which to summon and be treated as if you summoned at a single tier higher spell slot.

You gain the Hexing Toad Kiss ability. this allows you to kiss a target within 5 feet, target must be either willing or pass a strength saving throw, they will have disadvantage of grappled.
Target takes 2 D6 poison or acid damage then must pass a constitution saving throw or be transformed into a Toad for 2 hours as if by polymorph.
You can do this once per short rest.

The polymorphed creature can now use Hexed Toad Kiss. They must be in 5 feet of an ememy. Their target must pass a Dex save, disadvantage if unaware of the polymorphed creature.
The target will take 2 D4 poison or acid damage then must pass a constitution saving throw or also be transformed into a Toad as if by polymorph.
If attempted on you deals 0 damage and you have advantage on Con saving throws.
A polymorphed creature may also do this twice oer short rest.

(I find this ability way too fun as the target you turned could immediately kiss you back.)

<{----------[0]----------}>

(I am still working on Wildshape. And debating on if it should be Wild shape) 

Your Wildshape ignores the regular limitations of swim speed. But you can only transform into Toad or Frog related creatures.
In this form you are immune to the Toad kiss ability.

As you gain levels your non cr0 transformations will gain more damage, health and ac.

Upon reaching 6th, 10th and 14th level you may choose one mutation for your Giant Frog and Toad forms, choosing two at 14th level.
Become a size larger allowing you to swallow larger creatures. May only be taken once.

Gain a claw attack as an bonus action for a D8. Scales up if you take it again.

Gain Languid Perception. If you are still you can see Invisible and stealthed enemies within 15 feet of you. May only be taken once.

Gain a breath attack that hits enemies in a 15 feet cone with Acid damage that scales with your Swallow acid damage. May only be taken once.

Gain a plus 3 to AC and gain advantage on saving throws to grapple an opponent and to escape grapples yourself. May only be taken once

Gain the ability to use Hexing Toads Kiss ability even while transformed, giving an opponent disadvantage on their strength saving throw. May only be taken once.",dnd

Now that my potential players are hopefully gone... 

I need some advice. My DnD group is very combat heavy. We love making up new ways to use our abilities to the fullest and creatively defeating our enemies- which means we do combat a lot. Which also means in our current campaign, sometimes sessions turn into hours long fights against bosses.

I’m running the next campaign for our friend group, and I’ve been trying to think of a way to make boss fights quicker and allow my players more creativity in combat. 

Basically, I want to turn bosses into Zelda/Okami bosses. You need to figure out how to broach the boss’ defenses, stun the boss, and while the boss is down hit it for as much damage as humanly possible. 

Is this too complicated or a good way to make combat fun and interesting again? Obviously we would be using normal combat for most of the time. But, if for example I wanted my first boss to be combination of Queen Gohma (Ocarina of Time) and the Spider Queen (Okami) and only have them take serious damage when a certain part of them is exposed, would that end up making combat take too long? Or is it not as interesting as I think it’ll be?",dnd

None of us have played before. The bulk of what I understand I learned from listening to Not Another DnD Podcast. My fiance decided he needed to make his own world, so yeah.  I'm playing a lightfoot halfling bard named Tansy Tealeaf, my sister's playing a high elf moon druid named Astrid Airenodel (or something stupid like that). 

Here is what went down:

1. We enter Everwood, the chief is supposed to be a high elf named Lucan. Tansy's there on ""tour"" as a bard, also using it as an excuse to wander. Astrid's looking for dark elves after being a hermit for a year because she went home to find her parents missing.  Astrid is making everyone suspicious with her talk of dark elves. Tansy just wants a job. 
2. A guard named Larkin takes us to see the chief. Instead we meet this half-elf named Marca, who Astrid proceeds to insult because he's ""just a half-elf"" and should have more respect for ""her kind."" Tansy calls her a racist b\*\*\*\* because she is being one. Tansy does not like Astrid one bit and repeatedly insists that they're not together - just both happened to be seeking an audience with the chief. They get thrown in jail. 
3. They get thrown in a cell with a dude who turns out to be Lucan, the rightful chief. With Larkin's hints, they escape through a secret dungeon tunnel to a spider cave (a la Lord of the Rings) where Astrid does some fire and some ice knife, Tansy does some acrobatics up and down the cave walls, and Lucan does some slashing. Lucan finishes spider #1, Tansy finishes spider #2, jumping up the wall after it as it tries to escape.
4. The elves get charmed and fall asleep. Tansy resists with a nat20. She meets a gnome bard named Tiki who challenges her to a playoff, battle of the bards style, to convince him not to kill her and her companions. They tie with a 23 - so Tiki says best out of 3. He wins the next round, Tansy wins the last. Tansy's family is apparently a well-known reputable bard family - he's heard of the Tealeafs.  He decides to leave her alone, warns her about some dudes in the corridor ahead and leaves.
5. The elves wake up and say they had the strangest dream about the worst music ever. Tansy informs them that she just saved their asses and continues to dislike both Astrid and Lucan (though she likes Lucan better than Astrid) Honestly, she and Tiki really hit it off. 
6. After a long rest, the party continues through the tunnel, only to be surrounded by a bunch of gnomes and elves and crap....and that's where we'll end our session!

TL;DR, my sister's high elf ended up being a racist snooty brat, my halfling bard got into a battle of the bards and parkoured up and down cave walls on our first session. That checks out, doesn't it? Also how bad is it that Tansy low-key hates Astrid?",dnd

However, this misses a lot of the nuances of language learning to be used as the end all be all of how long it takes, and I am not convinced that most people could learn a language to the point of fluency in that amount of time, (particularly a more complicated one like elven) and would more consider a character who did that conversational, until they have been speaking the language regularly for a longer period of time. (A magic spell/item could obviously get you fluent in an instant because magic)

So if one wanted to add a bit more flavor to the process of language learning, how long would it take to be fully fluent? I think that could be a fun Variant to include in a campaign to make a world feel more fleshed out, or to allow for more developement if a particular character wants to learn a language as a goal.

I thought up a quick quest and encounter that I thought could be fun for anyone in a city environment.

The plot hook is a quest to find the source of disappearing people in a district of your choice. After talking to some npcs, the party can be led in the direction of the sewers. I used strange noises but it could be anything that makes sense. Upon entering the sewer the party sees an unusual amount of rats and upon a successful perception check can see claw marks to one side of the sewer. As they head down the sewer the number of rats increase. The rats will tend to avoid light and always stay at the edge of the light source and will not try and engage the party but if the party kills any the other rats will immediately devour the body. 

After heading down the sewer with the number of rats slowly increasing the party will run into a half eaten body hung on the wall. If your party doesn’t like gore you can make it a stripped skeleton. The right hallway is clear and has less rats. I added a trap with a plot hook for later in the campaign but you can close it off completely if you want. The left side has the rat numbers growing increasingly with multiple bodies. You can make it as gross as you want depending on the mood of the table or campaign. Eventually the party will be wading through rats. 

I designed the encounter for four level four characters but it can be changed for any amount. Continue if left they will eventually enter into an antechamber with three were rats 45 feet from the doorway and four rat swarms that immediately engulf each player. My party handled it really well with a really well timed thunder wave with many badly rolled saves and overall some smart decision making and bad roles for the enemies.

Druid: Circle of the Ocean

Druids of the Circle of the Ocean are wise, powerful protectors of the sea. Their orders focus on embodying the sea itself, using the nature-born powers to fend off those who wish  to desecrate it. They constantly linger near the water, despising those that have no appreciation for its beauties.

As adaptable as the water, druids of this circle will travel the seas as their sole protector, live in the deeps so as to protect its contents, and even roam the land making it known of the sea’s amazing qualities. Water, specifically the sea, is a part of this druid.

Circle Spells
Your connection to the water and its vast abilities grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the shape water cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of the Ocean Spells table.
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

Circle of the Ocean Spells
Druid Level     Spells

       9th             maelstrom, drown*

Blessing of the Sea
At 2nd level, your affinity to the sea grants you the ability to dwell within it. You gain the ability to breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

Watery Form
Starting when you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the powers to become water. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to assume a watery form, giving you the following benefits:

* You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
* You can’t be grappled or restrained.
* You take half damage from opportunity attacks during your turn, and you can move through another creature’s space but can’t willingly end your turn there.

This ability last for 10 minutes, or until you use your Wild Shape feature again. 

Protection of the Sea
At 6th level, the power of the sea protects you wherever you go. Whenever you are hit with an attack, you can use your reaction to summon a shield of water to protect you, giving you a +3 bonus to your AC until the beginning of your next turn. 

You can use this ability a number of times equal to you Wisdom modifier(minimum of +1). You regain all uses of this feature on a long rest.

Oceanic Transformation 
Starting at 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape to transform into a water elemental.

Apex of the Sea
At 14th level, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. In addition, you can cast the spell fog cloud at will.

/!\ Please notice i'm talking about 3.5 Edition /!\

What happens when a large size druid uses wild shape before 8th level ?

Before 8th level, a druid is not supposed to change into a large animal yet, but it doesn't really makes sense for him to change only into medium or small animals...

- Can he still only change into small/medium animals ? 
- Can he change into large animals (with HD < Drd level) ? 
- Can he only change into small/medium animals, but apply the rule to scale them one size bigger (+2 str, -2dex, natural weapons damage, etc...) ?

Yuno is quite resourceful, is extremely smart when it comes to stratagizing,  skilled in making traps,  and has fine expertise in standard combat,  especially with using bladed weapons. Her most notable weapons  throughout the series are an axe, knife, revolver, and katana. But she  really just uses any weapon that she can get her hands on. Yuno also has  some know-how on poisons and drugs, and is quite stealthy. She is  extremely durable, has a high pain tolerance, and is extremely strong.  On top of that she is very good at acting, deceiving others, trickery,  and has a sort of duel personality, one being a more friendly  personality, and another being a psychotic and insane personality.

My table uses a stat array of 17, 15, 13, 12, 10, and 8 due to our party size not being that large.

(This build does not include her future diary, that is something I am working with my DM to make, Ik that people will say divination wizard for her future diary and that's not what I'm going for)

Guess I can't edit the title.]

This isn't my content, but I'm so in love with it that I wanted to share.

When I first heard about the dwarf only barbarian subclass in SCAG, I was super intrigued.  A barbarian that not only wears armor, but becomes a weapon with the armor? Yes, please!  Then I read about it and, as many others were, was woefully underwhelmed.

I really wanted to play this type of character though, so I went a-searching for any posted revisions to the subclass.  Eventually I came across a real gem that I don't think has gotten enough love in the D&D community.

If you want to rage around the battlefield bashing, ramming, impaling, grappling the enemy as a spikey  weapon on legs, then I think you should really give The Path of the Spined Ravager, by Nerd Immersion and Firebringeraxel, a try.  I'm playing a character now and it's just so much fun! It's everything that I envisioned the Battlerager to be.  

They do a wonderful job of making the unique spike armor not just feel like a side piece to an axe wielding barbarian, but to make the armor feel like the main focus of the fighting style.  They also tie it into forgotten realms lore of existing battleragers and open up the role play ability to all races and armor types.  You can be the Pwent Thibbledorf like dwarf, or maybe even a lizardfolk in the swamp wearing leather armor with bone spikes!

***Tao Yin***

*Tao Yin was a powerful 16th level sorcerer of the Ishtar Collective and the adventuring guild. Tao Yin dies as the result of a curse of the minions of Vecna corrupting the political landscape. The curse affects her memory and therefore Tao can only remember a small part of the plot of Vecnas return but has collected several artifacts that are paramount to his defeat. To protect herself and remain undetected Tao stops using magic and travels the continent attempting to find heroes untouched by corruption. Tao fails and instead believes only those who come from nothing can remain incorruptible and instead chooses to foster a party to gain enough power to defeat Vecna. Tao however after a year succumbs to her curse but manages to settle In the small town of (placeholder) and crafts a will where she leaves these artifacts in the possession of the players.*

&#x200B;

  

***EYE OF VECNA/Holy Symbol***

*The eye of Vecna will be held In a holy symbol magical item, it can suppress the curses of the eye and prevent the wearer from being affect from the artifact. The item has an AC of 35 but instead of missing, a roll of 34 or lower results in the damage that would have been done to the holy symbol is dealt to the creature attacking as force and that creature is thrown 10 feet backwards and knocked prone by a blast of radiant energy. The holy symbol cannot hold the eye forever and will show signs of wear over time eventually breaking and releasing the eye.*

*Attuning and the Identity spell only reveals the properties of the symbol itself and not what lies within*

*The holy symbol will grow in power and will level with a character as long as it is physically on the player as they level up the holy symbol will gain additional features at levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20*

&#x200B;

  

***Sword of Kas***

*The sword of Kas cannot be destroyed easily so Tao instead had a master forger craft it into 2 new weapons, The twin daggers. The two daggers act as yin and yang. The master forger was corrupted by the bad dagger and attempted to steal them from Tao, she was weakened due to her curse however was still a powerful sorcerer so the master forger was only successful in stealing the bad dagger and replacing it with a fake.*

*Good dagger - maintains the aspects of the sword that are good, the need for justice and the destruction of the undead.*

*Bad dagger - maintains the aspects of the sword that are bad, obsession, greed, jealousy ect*

*Both daggers feel empty without the other and will attempt to convince their wielder to seek the other and re-join them to form the Sword of Kas* 

*The twin daggers will grow in power and will level with a character as long as it is physically on the player as they level up, the daggers will gain additional features at levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20*

913,How the deck of many things derailed two games in one day,3,jds5zy,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/jds5zy/how_the_deck_of_many_things_derailed_two_games_in/,0,1603098037.0,"Apologies if this gets confusing, but there are two different games that my group plays concurrently on Sundays. Each game is run by a different DM and each DM plays in the other's game. Two more of us play in both games, and each game has a few additional players. The games are back to back, game one in the afternoon and game two in the evening.

In game one, we've had a deck of many things for a little while. It's been set aside since its owner pulled a certain card and had his soul sucked from his body and put into a bubble hidden away somewhere. That player ended up making a new character, and saving the character is now on our long-term agenda. One of the characters held onto the deck.

Fast forward to today. Today we were presented with the BBEG and in a desperate attempt to avoid a fight we could not win, we started drawing cards from the deck again. A mess of things happened as a result, including BBEG drawing a card and coming into possession of something that could have helped us stop him. Whoops.

The other thing that happened is that someone pulled the wish card. This led to a bunch of time going by irl wherein we discussed how we could save our fallen friend, save another character, and keep the BBEG from getting that item. We eventually get past this and continue with the game, although we came back to the topic a few times.

Keep in mind, we do joke about the deck often but haven't drawn from it in probably months. No reason for anyone to think we'd run into BBEG or draw from the deck today.

Now on to game two. We catch our other friends up on the shenanigans resulting from our (mis?)use of the deck. Laughter is had.

We start the game. We had defeated a baddie at the end of the previous session but stopped before getting our magical items. So the DM brings out four magic items. Among them… A deck of many things.

We have a laugh about game one. Then one of our players decided to draw a card, because what are the odds he'll pull the soul in a bubble card, right?

Well…. He pulled it. Chaos ensued. More cards were drawn because we figured there was only one of the soul sucking cards and if not, what are the odds, right?

One card was something mild. The next.. Well.. The first player who lost his character in game one, pulled the same card again. Turns out, a deck of many things has two of those soul suckinf cards. Who knew?

The other player in the meantime had started pulling together a spare character and joined us on our journey to, well, find himself. Completely derailing the main plotline which had been building for the last year.

Yeah. Whoops.

Tl;dr: the deck of many things derailed two games, resulting in a BBEG getting a powerful item and two characters' souls getting sucked out. Now we must decide if it's worth the risk to continue using the deck to save our friends/defeat the big bad.

(In hindsight I think the cards are slightly different from each other but honestly I don't want to look it up and spoil the fun of not knowing what else is in the deck)",dnd

So what is a game master to do? Random encounters? Travel montages? Teleportation? Those are all reasonable options, but the right answer is going to depend on what works for your group.

I spent a good portion of the summer of 1990 sitting in the back of a vintage 1970’s van on the Pacific Coast Highway reading Stephen King’s Salem’s Lot. Like most teenagers during the pre-social media/Reddit years, I was confined in a vehicle with only a Toshiba Walkman with a Lost Boys soundtrack cassette tape (a soundtrack which still holds an honored spot in my now digital music collection). Having completed the last page of the book with the double-sucker punch King likes to bestow upon his readers, I was left to ponder the greatness of the Marsten house and the vivid imagery of the undead. I began to write a horror role-playing game. I believe it was the perfect storm of the book, the Santa Cruz boardwalk, the misty thick forests of the northwest (forget Forks, Washington) and the incomparable sound of Gerard McMahon singing “Cry Little Sister” that gave the first inception of A Tale of Darkened Nights life.

 

The original game, crafted for 2nd edition Dungeons and Dragons (remember that?) was much different than the version that exists today though some key elements are the same. In my world, I wanted a house and all of the terrible secrets held within to be a key fixture. I created the Marlowe line of succession which proved to be a double win when I found out in college lit Marlowe means “from the hill by the lake.” That wretched house and the “monster” hidden within has remained in my life for several decades. Though he has changed in degrees of complexity, my Marlowe villain has proven to have staying power.

 

The game poured out like a fire hydrant and like a fire hydrant, it was all over the place. It was a teenager’s dream game with all of the Gothic horror frills and 90’s pop culture references (17-year old author, people) and it grew into a campaign. Following the trip and the successive completion of the game, I corralled my friends Goonie’s-style and embarked on a creeptatstic adventure that began in August and wrapped close to the following July. There were ghosts, ghasts, seers, seances, terror and triumph and it was an absolute blast. I still recall the gaming session, when I told my friends to “shut up” so I could write the address of an adorable girl in my band class on the NPC character sheet—an adorable girl who ended up becoming my wife who, for some reason, agreed to join me in this madness.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Years pass and I am college-bound with my copy of A Tale of Darkened Nights with me. As a dual art and creative writing major, I channeled Weis, Hickman, Elmore and Caldwell and poured my new education into the game. As a young 20-something, I spent time in my own ABC Café, with tabletop outbursts of indignation worthy of a Cameron Mackintosh production. The themes of A Tale of Darkened Nights evolved and became more sophisticated. Pathos and tragedy, love and loss appeared in a celebratory tribute to what a rave would look like with Poe, Dickens, Shelly, Roger Waters, Lovecraft and Mr. King (still). The campaign became epic and theatrical and became a close cousin of a Vampire: The Masquerade with an “all the world is a stage” sentiment.

 

This version became my passion project, my own symphony with 20-sided dice. I took it to eleven, reworked everything and made a prototype with visits to the only color copier in town to literally cut and paste and make a drop-dead gory-geous copy. Oh how this was going to change the world I—

 

\--graduated, got married and had a son.

 

The Marlowe House monster had to wait in the corner and be good because my little one was sleeping.

 

Naturally, the monster didn’t behave and he sent me up to Renton, WA to set foot in the official Wizards of the Coast den to pitch the art and the game. Though A Tale of Darkened Nights had to percolate a little more, I did fetch a Magic Card (Hickory Woodlot – Mercadian Masques…Google it—that’s me) and became a mysterious one-card entity who went into interior design and trompe l’oeil murals.

 

This was dad time and called for commissioned work, swim meets, making lunches and being there. The Marlowe House monster went back into the box.

 

This time, he was triple-locked.

 

Time passed, my son grew and he became as obsessed with role-playing as I had been. Getting his hands on my A Tale of Darkened Nights prototype he unleashed the Marlowe House monster and sent him at me with his full blessing.

 

I didn’t stand a chance. My son dared to say the “c” word: collaboration.

 

In mid-2019, I set about to create an entire new catalogue of illustrations, maps and splash art to accompany an overhaul of A Tale of Darkened Nights for the modern DnD system. Surprisingly, it adapted very well and it didn’t take long before the vision rematerialized into something worthy of sharing with the world. We knew we had to place this on the market. 10,000 edits, over 100 sketches, nearly 70,000 words later, A Tale of Darkened Nights was completed.

 

I had no idea that working with my son would have been the best part of this whole wild ride. With his encouragement, we started De Vellenti Role-Playing Games and get to await the release of our debut campaign.

 

It is our sincere hope that this 30 year journey brings you the same joy and exhilaration as it has brought me, my loved ones, and my friends over the years.

 

Without further ado, I present:

&#x200B;

“Listen dear friend and you shall hear,

A tale of darkened nights,

Where cold enwraps this time of year,

And the moon shines half as bright...”

 

 

There is an undeniable chill in the air. Perhaps the coldness arises from the changing of the seasons, or perhaps there is something of an evil nature.

 

From the shadowy avenues of Porte de Dalamir creatures of legend, the changelings, wander in search of the innocent.

 

A notorious figure from the past returns to seek vengeance, driving this realm into a nightmare of calamity and madness.

 

Those called upon to put an end to the tragedy must face a perilous world of hidden mysteries, ghastly apparitions and continual darkened nights.

 

Release date:  October 18, 2020

 

 

Presenting A Tale of Darkened Nights, the debut role-playing campaign from DeVellenti Role-Playing Games.

My first one is Claustrophobia.  If you want you can put down below how you would play a character with this phobia. So now I’m gonna talk about backstory and what happens when they get this phobia. If I played a character with claustrophobia it would be like this. When a character is in this stat they have disadvantage on attacks. Of course you would have to make a roll to see if you freeze up a bit but not all the way which is why you can still attack. Best race to play this character would prob be goblin and rogue. So if you have to make someone go under somewhere small and you make him there’s a possibility he can freeze up in there or the character can just say no. The backstory I had in mind would be like this. He lives in a wealthy family that wants him to be perfect. The thing is he keeps making a lot of mistakes. So they lock him in his closet to show that if he’s not perfect they will keep doing it. He tried his best but he kept making mistakes. One night the rich parents was so mad at him that instead of locking him in his they kicked him out. While that happened they decided to try and have another kid and they did and she was exactly what they wanted. They kicked him out when he was 13 by the way and they also told him to find a new family. He did he lived with farming people who he loved. But even though he was happy he was away from his parents that locked him in his closet. He still wanted to prove that he could be perfect. So one last thing you might be like this story is to dark for dnd but reminder I haven’t actually played this character.,dnd

[It was inspired by this video](https://youtu.be/RlHom7zSWD0), which I attempted to refine and create more concrete rules for the scenario.

This is how it goes:

The players walk into a room with a circular table that has 4 chairs and 2 empty chalices in front of each(1 chair and 2 chalices per player; I have 4 players). Once each player takes a seat, walls rise up to separate each player. Once the walls are up, each player will see that the 2 chalices in front of them have been slightly filled, and on one of their chalices is written a riddle that pertains to the death of a certain pc, for example:

Those without one true form,
Against this drink, they have been warned.

That relates to a pc who’s a shapeshifter.

The other chalice has no writing.

The pc in front of the chalices chooses one, and they both vanish. In front of them appears another set of chalices, also partially filled, with a different warning of death pertaining to a different pc written on one of the chalices. They choose one and the process repeats until every pc has chosen a chalice for every pc except themself. Once they do this, the walls fall and the players see that there is a filled chalice in front of each of them.

How this works is each character drinks the combination of what every other character chose for them. For clarification, say that player 1 and player 3 both chose the poison chalice for player 4, and player 3 chose the non-labeled chalice. Player 3 would then drink their chalice and be reduced to 0 hp. But, if player 1 had chosen the non-labeled chalice instead of the poison, player 3 would simply get a few negative effects like 1 point of exhaustion. And of course, if players 1,2 and 3 choose the non-labeled chalice for player 4, player 4 would be totally fine.

The whole idea is to build trust, but also expose mistrust, since if anyone is poisoned, whether they die or not, they will know someone in the group tried to kill them.

I’m still workshopping this idea though and kinda wanna change a few things, like instead of having something written on he non-labeled chalices, but I can’t think of anything right now. If you guys have any ideas or suggestions please let me know, this idea seems really cool to me and I wanna execute it properly. Thanks!✌️✌️",dnd

950,Dnd Tower Defense,4,jdqael,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/jdqael/dnd_tower_defense/,0,1603090780.0,"Hi. First post here.

So, me and my group have recently been filling off-sessions with less than serious games of simply tower defense (the party has something to defend, the dm throws a bunch of combat encounters at them. Two examples below.) In essence, it is about taking DnD and using its rules for a laid back tabletop gaming experience. 

I have found this to be fun and beneficial in a number of ways, which I will detail. That's why I decided to make this post.

The basics:
What you need as a DM is:
- A few players (I have been playing with 3 of our 6 regular players) 
- A combat map that works for multiple waves of enemies. 
- A a series of escalating combat encounters for the map.

The benefits of this are:

1. Testing grounds
Because there is no pressure to have any of the game work properly, you and your players can test out a bunch of things. Your build inclined players getto field test their beastly builds. Your RP inclined players get a microcosm to test out their voices and personalities. You, the DM, get to test out the nastiest, weirdest, most unlikely monster combinations. All over it teaches you about a lot of the game that you can normally never play, because it's too much of an investment.

2. Hone your skill.
Because you only have the bare minimum, you the DM have to flex your muscles to make repeated combat encounters in the same arena interesting and dynamic. Have the monsters break your arena, absolutely brutalized the players and npcs; anything to make it interesting. It's OK, cos in the end it's just an off session that's not too serious. You, the player, can flex your combat narration, and in-combat role play.

3. It's dnd, but a board game.
You can pick this up with minimal preparation. Just toss together a vague scenario, a few characters, have your monster manual handy, and you're good to go. It has really opened me up to the simple game play fun that dnd has to offer.

So. Now for two brief examples.

On our first session, the party were in a crossroads tavern when a powerful wizard enchanted a pickle to be the most precious item in the entire world, to have the party defend a ring he stuck into it from the hordes of Orcus. The poor commoners visiting the tavern got unfortunately and brutally murdered as the demons fought the players over a pickle.

Another session, the players found themselves hired by the captain of a ship, to defend it as they explored the deep oceans of Deepocean. Oh how the players panicked when they realized the sea elf druids riding plesiosauri were trying to wreck the ship from below.

Overall, it's just a new fun way for us to play tee game, and I can't recommend it enough.",dnd

My friend said the difficulty kind of relies on how creative you can be with making your items, and while I would consider myself to be a fairly creative person, I'm wondering if it's still too advanced of a class to start with?

If it is a good class, then would you guys have any advice on how to play as one? Or anything I should prepare myself for?

Also it is going to be a bit long.

I'm a fairly new DM. I began in january when I was tired of watching critical role and DND memes, and  I wanted to play but had no one i knew who could DMed.Now, i'm running a homebrew campaign, going from heavy rp sessions to heavy combat ones. The coronavirus put this on hold because some of us had old computers which couldn't run a vttrpg smoothly.

I just had a session a few hours ago. And for now, most of the fights have been quite easy for the team so I wanted to try to give them a bit more challenge. And this time, it was indeed more challenging.

The tempest cleric tried to finish a monster with a guiding bolt, nat 1 (usually nat 1 are not really punishing, they are just miss with a bit more extra fun flavor, except for saving throws where it does nothing, even if some players would like if they were). So, ok, turn goes, and again cleric turns. And the paladin, who was just next to the monster he had missed previously, open his damn mouth (I don't blame him at all but i was like, oh no don't say it please), ""If you do another nat 1, i'm taking the bolt.""...

And, of course, Murphy's law, nat 1. God dammit.

So I manage to convince him that it only graze him, or something like that, and he takes half damage. But the paladin actually had some kind of a Sword of vengeance. Nat 1 on the wisdom saving throw. Of course, his attention is shifted to the cleric. His turn comes, he rushes for the cleric and decide to put everything, smite and all on the cleric. He survives but takes quite a lot of damage. And then, cleric, tells me he uses his reaction to use his wrath of the storm feature. Of course, he rolled nearly max damage, the paladin doesn't make the saving throw and goes unconscious.

The party was a bit split and the cleric doesn't want to help the paladin while others are still fighting/needing help because he tried to kill him for apparently no real reason.

So they finish the fight and just before someone can come help the paladin, he rolls his 3rd failed death saving throw in a row...

A NPC they met recently, who fought with them, comes and uses a revivify spell scroll. I actually wanted to give it to them after the fight, as thanks, it was not supposed to be use but it was writen on paper that she had it. But I see my player hesitate so I tell him : ""You can decide if you come back or if you want to go rest in peace."". But it's a huge decision, and time was running out, so I tell everyone, that we will get his answer at the next session.

So here it is, I just wanted to share, if you have any advice, reaction or if you would have run it differently, just say it, I'm open to discussion and I am convinced I have a lot to learn from you, even if I already learned a lot from reddit and other forums.

The second one I call the wholesome warlock. So instead of the warlock selling their soul or having to sacrifice children or things like that. So what if in return for their powers, the patron just wanted their love and devotion. So instead of their patron showing them bad and or traumatic things, they would show them all the things they want to do with them like cuddle, dance, go on dates and all those other kind of things lovers do. And when they talk to them in their heads they tell the warlock how much they love them and how wonderful they are.

I'm into the whole thing mostly because of the weird, fantastic settings, and I think my favorite apsect of these are the weird and majestic creatures found in the D&D multiverse. I've devoured the 5e Monster Manual, Volo's Guide to Monsters and Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, and whenever I get my hands on a new module, it doesn't take long until I find myself looking through the monster appendix at the end of the book. Sometimes its the astonishing drawings that get stuck in my head and practically tell their own tales in my imagination, the evocative descriptions and histories that just beg to find ways to be implemented in my game world, or the statblocks that just make my inner DM kick in and start planning the next session around them. 

Since my thirst for cool monsters can't be satiated, I've found myself flipping through older D&D edition Monster Manuals, and even checking out Pathfinder books. So far, I think my favorites are 5e's Volo's Guide (the new, weird monsters, that feel way more odd and unique next to the Monster Manual's more vanilla vibe) and Pathfinder 2e's Bestiary 1 (I really like Pathfinder's style, different take on familiar themes and overall odd, wackier vibe), but its a really hard choice, because most books I've had the luck of going through left me feeling fascinated and inspired. 

I wanted to ask what bestiary/monster book is your favorite, and if you can explain why. You can go through every D&D edition (also Pathfinder), but I'd prefer you'd stick to offical material (unless you really like that 3rd party book and can't think of anything else).

Regardless, though, one of the things I've actually missed, in 5e, is the stats for a high-level NPC cleric. As is, they give me the **Drow Priestess of Lolth**, and I like that, but something a little stronger; the equivalent of an **archmage**, would be nice. In 3e, we might've seen Bane's Chosen Tyrant, Fzoul Chembryl, and I was even slightly surprised that RotFM didn't include Iyraclea, even by reference. If you don't know, back in the day, she was a Chosen of Auril, and one of Her strongest clerics. Regardless, what I'd like is some help with the spells.

In my opinion, 5e clerics don't necessarily have it as easy as 3e ones did; the fewer Domains mean that fewer non-Cleric spells get slipped onto their lists, such as the elemental AoE spells. Clerics still have a very good list, in my opinion, but a lot of it is good because it benefits the party they are with; again, some people don't give their encounters healing because it just draws out fights, so what players are glad to have for themselves, they aren't as keen to see NPCs using against them. Every once in a while, an NPC gets a list of prepared spells; sometimes it's crud, or heavily tailored for how the campaign wants their encounter to go (Acererak), and sometimes it's just decent (Halaster Blackcloak). It's usually wizards; I like Wizards, and I know their spell list better, as well as somewhat the task(s) they want to achieve with their spells, but I can't do that as easily with clerics. I was wondering if anyone might be interested in assisting with building a good encounter list/Spellcasting feature for a Cleric NPC; something that helps them deal with threats, force-multiply, support their lackeys, and the other sorts of things you would expect them to cast, if say the party kicked in the door to the Temple of Bane, and engaged Fzoul before he could finish some ritual that would allow Bane to become more powerful, or some such. If he had to fight a party, with cleric spells, as an 18thlevel caster, what would he prepare? So many of the books have BBEGs, but they aren't ""evil clerics"", and even those who serve a deity, like Arkhan the Cruel, aren't depicted as true casters. Please make some suggestions to fill the spaces, with the idea that this is against a party of players?

If I was going to field a hierophant, something like Iyraclea or Fzoul, such a good list of their prepared spells would be helpful, since I know their list less well; especially if they aren't fielding as many healing or out-of-battle supports, like *remove curse*, or *cure disease*.

I'm a moderately experienced DM who has mostly run their own campaigns in the past. I'm currently running the Phandelver ""tutorial"" for some first-timers, and while I thought it would be breezy using pre-written stuff, I'm actually finding it a lot harder.

Session planning has now become incredibly stressful instead of fun, to the point where I've cancelled a couple times because I couldn't bring myself to get ready.

What's difficult for me when using a module is that they are *way more detailed* than I thought they'd be. So instead of having all my written characters and motives and quests on paper and in my head, ready to be fudged at a moment's notice, I've got this semi-rigid adventure with specific characters and story beats (that honestly I'm not super interested in).

I'm having trouble keeping all the stuff I read in my head. And then I get stressed having to look stuff up while playing. Especially dungeons (I don't do many proper, capital-D Dungeons in the adventures I write, mostly theater of mind).  I'm also nervous about the adventurers getting farther than I've planned for the day, in which case I'd have no idea what to do.

I'm currently planning to write them out of the module and into my own stuff, but that's going to take a while to get to.

**What I currently do**

* Read over the ""chapter"" we're on again and physically write out the stuff I find most important
* Try to refamiliarize myself with the current NPCs
* Open DND Beyond tabs for my players and the monsters we may encounter (and set them up in Improved Initiative)
* Go over the player character sheets real quick
* Glance at the next chapter if I have time

It still doesn't feel like enough and it's making me so anxious. I know I'm overthinking it in certain ways, but I also feel like I might be able to spend my time and energy more efficiently.

Two problems though. First, I’ve never played it! Not that big a deal, I have all the books and everything. But these are space marines. How the hell am I supposed to give them a challenge? How am I to gauge what they can an can’t handle to fight against? 

Second: I’ve never DMd before. While their are campaigns in the books none of them really appeal to me and like I do with all my armies, I’d rather build a custom lore around things in universe. I’m currently building the system, the campaign and everything detailing it out. But how do I know if things are too detailed. Or if I don’t have enough? 

No one I know has ever DM’d a game like this before, so I can’t get their input. So I’ll throw this out into the community. How much detail is too much? Are there any DMs out there that could help me with building this world? What kinda scenes would you like to see?",40k

I am playing with a Chaos Space Marine's and had a question about the Icon of Wrath and the Fury of Khorne Tactic.

&#x200B;

**(1)**

In the KT manual the Icon of Wrath states:

>""You can re-roll charge rolls for KHORNE models within 6"" of any friendly models equipped with an  
>  
>Icon of Wrath.""

***My question:*** Does this apply to the model that is, itself, equipped with the Icon of Wrath? Can the model equipped with the Icon of Wrath also re-roll charge rolls? Or is it strictly only for OTHER models within 6"" of the model equipped with the Icon of Wrath, and NOT the model equipped with the Icon itself?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**(2)**

I have a similar question regarding the COMMS Specialist's Level 1 ability ""Scanner"".

The KT manual states for the Scanner ability:

>""Once per Shooting phase, when you pick a model from your kill team to shoot that is within 6"" of this model, if this model is not shaken, you can add 1 to hit rolls for that model in this phase.""

***My question:*** Similar to the Icon of Wrath question, does this only apply to OTHER models? Or can the COMMS Specialist model use this ability for ITSELF during the shooting phase and add a 1 to its own hit rolls?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**(3)**

My last question regards the Fury of Khorne Tactic

The KT manual state for the Fury of Khorne Tactic:

>""Use this Tactic at the end of the Fight phase. Pick a KHORNE model from your kill team that is within 1"" of an enemy model – your model can immediately fight again.""

***My question:*** How many models does this tactic apply to? If I have multiple Khorne models on my KT, do all of my Khorne models immediately fight again when using this tactic? Or do I just pick one single Khorne model to immediately fight again?

&#x200B;

**NOTE:** These references come from the ***8th edition KT manual***. I know it's old, but it was a free download online, and  I can't imagine there are very many differences regarding these tactics, but if so please share.

&#x200B;

I can just have multi lasers on the valks and have auto cannons on the taurox's for more consistent damage output at longer range.

I am trying to put together my first list on Battlescribe and am struggling with how to put together a good composition for my forces. I am cobbling together some Valhallans I found very cheap on ebay along with some Cadians (Cadian Defense Force box I found discounted) that I plan to do some kitbashing with 3rd party heads to make into Valhallans. I have the general idea of how battlescribe works, but do not know all the rules for force composition yet. I'm going to list what I have so far so I can get a good idea what to kit out my plastic Cadian ""Valhallans"" with (I honestly don't know if there's options in their sprues besides lasguns as this is my first 40k purchase). So far what I have includes

1 Chimera

1 Leman Russ

1 Cadian Heavy Weapon Squad - (whatever is included from Cadian Defense Force)

1 Cadian Command Squad

20 Cadians (from above box)

20 Cadians (4x5 man box)

18 Valhallans w/ Lasguns

3 Valhallan leaders (1 commissar)  
3 Valhallan Support Teams - 1 Mortar, 2 Heavy Bolters

2 Valhallans w/Meltas, 1 w/Grenade Launcher, 2 w/(Plasma? can't tell from ebay picture)

The Codex and Field Manual seem to consider Hellstrike Missiles rather differently. Valkyries in the codex have ""hellstrike missiles"" which are 10pts in the Field Manual under Astra Militarum. If you look in the Field Manual under Forge World Astra Militarum units ""hellstrike missile"" is 10 points.

This is where things get wierd because Forge World flyers can take 2 or 4 of these usually and they are listed as an individual missile. The Valkyrie profile in the codex seems to consider ""hellstrike missiles"" as a single weapons system with Heavy 1 (despite having 2 missiles on the model).

Does this mean that they should actually be treated as 2 different weapons systems in the game? The Valkyrie has a single 10 point heavy 1 shot and each individual Forge World missile is a 10 point heavy 1 shot. This effectively gives the Vulture with 2 hellstrike missiles twice the hellstrike firepower of a Valkyrie despite both models having 2 missiles physically on them.

The other thing here is that they are not single shot weapons (not an issue, they just look like they should be).

Ignoring choice of models (yes), what is the cheapest way to go about building a Soup Army.

Do I have to buy all the codecies (in paper or pdf) or is there a free option that provides all the info?

Are there reasons to limit how many sub-factions are in your soup army? Is limiting your self to 3 better than 4, or 5, ect.?
(More rules to remember?)

---+---+---+---+---

I am a complete newbie! Been lurking in terms of lore for a while (thanks Luetin09). Only started buying models in 2020. 

Although I have a fondness for Orks (looting/kitbashing other factions tanks) what really interests me is ""soup"" both Imperial and Chaos.

My reasons are my own:
1) I want to collect and paint a wide variety of models, not just a mono faction or sub-faction, and
2) This will also me to play a wide variety of games with friends both kill team and small force size 40k. I'll probably supliment with a few Xenos here and there (Orks & Necrons).

I'm not really concerned with how compedative the theoretical list is at this point.  As a new player I simply don't expect to be turnament compedative

Without getting into model choices (what you say? crazy right?) what is the most economical way to get into building a ""Soup Army""?

How much planning would YOU put into it vs buying what you like and I then just trying to make it work?

What's the cheapest way to get all the info from the relavent codecies?

Hence I have complied a list of Warhammer Animations.

Note: These do not include in-game cut scenes nor clips from the Ultramarine movie . Also I was unable to list every single one across the web, if you have more .   
For  Statues, it is if they have uploaded any new animation relating to WH40K in the last year.

I need some help from veterans on list building / tactics for the GSC, so I figured I would consult the community and see what comes of it.

&#x200B;

**Crusades Campaign**

I will be playing a Crusade campaign with some friends soon, but I am pretty woefully out of the loop when it comes to list building. I cut my teeth on 3-5th edition and so I have alot to catch up on 40k wise.

&#x200B;

**List Building**

I've been tinkering with list building and have constructed these two with a third on the way, but their is so much to look at its a bit overwhelming. I will be facing Blood Angels and Chaos Marines (yay). I tried to cover all my bases, but that's really hard to do at Patrol level. The game will be escalating to Incursion after a few weeks, but I want a decent list to start with.

# Alternate List - Light Assault Force

Patrol Detachment - \[33 PL, 3CP, 499pts\] Cult Creed: The Rusted Claw

Tactics: *Deploy the two sentinels and the Goliath on the board and weaken them with some Heavy weapons fire. Capture small objectives and try to contest the mid field. Sentinels can deal/absorb decent damage/have Blast if I need it. Bring in the Iconward / Acolytes to assault the enemy from ambush in mid game, and or capture objectives in the back field. I figure stacking bonuses on +1 STR and -1 to enemy armor could come in handy against marines since rock saws are great, but STR5 isn't too bad against them either.*

I know that a lot of people are ironical when they spam ""FOR THE GOD EMPEROR"" or ""PURGE THE XENOS"" or similar, but many other people i've met also actually nearly unironically worship the God-Emperor and the Imperium irl. I'm sorry i'm posting this, i don't want to flame. Is just that recently i was blocked permanently and heavily insulted by a ""friend"" of mine that told me i'm a failure and an impulsive toxic fucktard and lack brains and other personal attacks just because i expressed my dislike on some overly-exaggerated aspects of 40k and on some ultra-violent decontextualized fanfictions he kept sending me about Space Marines murdering other random, non-war based settings. 

Why is this community so littered by overly zealous people like that? I always wanted to get interested in this series but people like that and the overall ""mainstream"" community always turned me down. I prefer the lore and world aspect of the series rather than the destruction/violence aspect or the roleplay/trolling part of it. Are there any other people that are more ""moderate"" like this in the community?

I would actually like Warhammer 40k, but i don't want to be associated with the angry kids with identity issues that want to identify with a fictional, purpusefully over the top nation, or with the overzealous violence fetishists and the guys who use this fandom to promote real life extremist movements.

Again i'm sorry for posting this, i don't want to fight with anyone or be mean against the whole community of the series, i just wanted to vent about this things that were in my mind for a while and today got out all at once after that thing happened with my ex friend.",40k

This not taking into account the rules for obscuring terrain which are pretty clear.

I personally enjoy having models in dynamic poses and converting them a little, which, with the aforementioned rule, exposes me to volleys of fire despite being able to hide my bases entirely from the attacker’s one, only because a muzzle or the tip of a sword was sticking out.
I very much don’t like it, but often the opponents don’t mind taking advantage of it.

So my question is, do you use the obscuring rule for all buildings to avoid some of these instances? Do you try to measure line of sight only with straight lines from base to base, to avoid penalizing stuff that has wings or long barrels? Do you roll with it and try to build your models in as self contained poses as possible? Or maybe you simply don’t care and just hope that luck even things out?

I'm new to 40K and have recently played my first game vs a friend, who is also new. 

During the game we ran into an issue we cannot seem to find the answer to, so I was hoping for some clarification.

The problem:

Astra millitarum vehicles can shoot multiple wepons during their shooting turn (heavy bolters, machine guns ect). Before shooting, the vehicle has to declare it's targets. In this case it was aiming at a group of cryptothralls standing next to a cryptotek. As the cryptotek is a HQ he cannot be targeted as long as he remains close to the cryptothralls, but can the astra millitarum player state that he will use his first weapon on the cryptothralls and then use the rest on the cryptotek IF the cryptothralls die? He would obviously lose his attacks if the cryptothralls then does not die, but we are unsure if this is even allowed as the cryptotek is not a valid target when he states his attacks.",40k

How tall are 40K Orks from base to head?

Are there any Orks from other games or some other variation of 40K that might have smaller models?

Edit: Just noticed on the base that they're from 1992... Didn't think they were THAT old.

* A transport was surrounded by a unit in melee;
* Due to positioning, it wouldn't be possible for the entire embarked unit to be set up fully within 3"" of the vehicle without also being in engagement range of a hostile model.

The rules for disembarking state that a disembarking unit *cannot* be set up in engagement range of an enemy model, which we took to mean that the unit cannot voluntarily disembark.

However, if the transport were destroyed at this point, the unit would be required to disembark, and have no legal way to do so. The rulebook doesn't seem to state what should happen in this case.

We ruled that, in that scenario, the models of the disembarking unit that couldn't be legally set up would be destroyed; but I'm interested in if there is anything we missed that would resolve the issue definitively.

**Edit:** It has been pointed out to me that p198, *Unit Coherency* states that 
> Sometimes there will be insufficient room to set up all models from a unit ... When this is the case, any models that cannot be set up are considered to have been destroyed.

For example, if I have a 10 model unit consisting of 9 CSM + 1 aspiring champion, the codex says "" Each model is armed with a boltgun, bolt pistol, frag grenades and krak grenades."" However, what the models actually have is a hodgepodge of mostly bolt pistols and chainswords.

Were people just confused by the wording of ""Regardless of the source, S, T, A, and LD characteristics of a model cannot be modified below 1[?]"" That is not the same as limiting the stacking of modifiers to +/- 1, it just means your stats can't go to zero or negative...",40k

I'm looking to get back into the hobby after a long hiatus (I believe fifth edition was the last time I played) and while searching through my copious amounts of eldar i found several spruces of admech. After coming through it looks like I have 2 skitarri start collecting boxes (so 2 dunecrawlers, about 20 skittari), a dominus, three kataphrons, and cawl. Everything on sprue except the characters so I can build whatever.  So some questions

1) I know i have to buy the codex, but i also have to buy the Engine War supplement?

2) Any suggestions on how to build kataphron/skitarri? I've been told vanguard is best, I've also been told mix between rangers and vanguard and run multiple 5 man squads? I have no idea about the kataphrons at all, the dunecrawlers I'm going to magnetize so I'm not worried about that.

3) Suggestions and what to get next? All the models looks so cool! I've heard kastellan dakkabots are really good, do I need transports (I heard 9th is going to be transport meta heavy). The bipedal walkers look sick as hell!

By the grace of Saint Katherine, we shall continue to do so for centuries to come, until all that would challenge the might of the Imperium have been turned to ash!

The 5th Sororitas Mission of the Order of Our Martyred Lady, ""Saint Katherine's Fury"", is an Adepta Sororitas focused unit, with a primary focus on the Grimdark Armory mod. In addition to Sororitas, we also have a Guard Auxiliary attachment, consisting of infantry, armor, logistics, and artillery. Additionally, should interest be present, we will also be opening a small Mechanicus attachment consisting of Skitarii. Our operations happen at a variety of times and days - everyone will have a chance to attend. We have both a main set of operations with a fluid narrative, and a number of side operations that are more free and fun.

We are just now opening our doors for a public release! This has been a project that myself and the other staff have long been interested in doing, and we've finally put our heads together to make it happen. We are very much trying to build an open an accepting community. We'd like to have a community where we not only play Warhammer 40k in Arma together and discuss the lore of the Sisterhood and other 40k topics, but also a community where we can support each other, help each other out when needed, and play other games together. 

As a note, we have a zero tolerant policy on trolls, racism, sexism, homophobia, or any other kind of harassment that is in violation of our rules. We take this very seriously - Warhammer is for everyone, and we uphold that ideal in our server.

(First sorry for my english, I'm not a native speaker) I'm new to the 40K universe (learned about it 3 months ago)  I've decided that my first army will be Eldar, and I would like to know what you think about the fluff and the concept, if you think that the changes that I made are lore-friendly or not, and what can I do to improve it. In a nutshell, my army would be composed primarily out of multiple modified Wraithbone constructs, that instead of being controlled by the souls of the dead, are being controlled by the mind of sleeping/dreaming eldars, with some Bonesingers as support ''healing'' them, and some rangers doing their thing.   


The lore is that they're descendents of the Il-Kaithe craftworld ([https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Il-Kaithe](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Il-Kaithe)) famous for their creative artists and skilled Bonesingers. But after the fall,  Il-Kaithe choose to follow a path of hatred and vengence against the Dark gods and now, these same craftsmen have turned their skills to creating only weapons. However, some of their Eldars were against that. Especially one, a follower of the Path of the Dreamer that got stuck in this path, he spoke about his discontent publicly, said that this anger and desire of vengence wouldn’t help them and would only fuel the powers of the chaos gods like Khorne, and that the time of the Eldar was over and war woudn’t save them. He was shunned, declared a traitor and a coward. But his speech was enough to convice some other disillusioned Eldar that joined him in his exile.

They fled as outcasts. He taught his followers about the path of the Dreamer and the new abilities he discovered, not only being able to control his own dreams but being able to enter the dreams of others, and to modifying everything, including their memories. He also discovered a way to interact with Realspace while in this state, and so how to control Wraithguards ( and etc...) with his mind while asleep. They don't really have an objective (until Ynnead arrived) they simply accepted that the time of the Eldar is over, and disagree with the ways of the craftworlds. They just want to survive and relive their past lives before the fall of the eldar in their dreams, rather than fight and die in a hopeless battle. Until Ynnead arrived and they saw it as a sparkle of hope and decided to join their ranks. And that's it. I know it needs some more lore, but what do you guys think?",40k

EDIT: hes not the original warlord either, he currently lacks a character keyword.

the first one i wanna put on him is this one:
-
""Corrupted Heirlooms (1/3 CP): Use this Stratagem before the battle. Select one KNIGHT DESPOILER, KNIGHT TYRANT or ABHORRENT CLASS model from your army for 1 CP, or select two such models for 3 CP. Each model you select gains the CHARACTER keyword and can have one Artefact of Tyranny. All of the Artefacts of Tyranny that your army includes must be different and be given to different CHAOS KNIGHTS CHARACTERS. You can only use this Stratagem once per battle.""

the second one i wanna put on him is this one:
- 
""Tyrannical Court (1/3 CP): Use this Stratagem before the battle, after nominating your Warlord. Select one KNIGHT DESPOILER, KNIGHT TYRANT or ABHORRENT CLASS model from your army that is not your Warlord for 1 CP, or select two such models for 3 CP. These models gain the CHARACTER keyword. For each of these models, generate one Chaos Knight Warlord Trait; the model is regarded as your Warlord for the purposes of that Warlord Trait. Each Warlord Trait in your army must be unique (if randomly generated, re-roll duplicate results). You can only use this Stratagem once per battle.""

basically, i just wanna use the two 1 CP options on him.
would him already being a character prevent him from having the second stratagem, or can i just ignore the part where he gains a second character keyword?",40k

I like the idea of taking one of the Primarch lines with a flawed gene-seed and  making a non codex compliant chapter questing for a cure. 

WHAT PRIMARCK OR PARENTS CHAPTER WOULD YOU RECOMMEND FOR THIS?

Basic outline goes something like this.

1) Gene seed tithe to mechanism reviels flaw.

2) Someone finds ancent record describing S.T.C. fragment dealing with genetic therapy/medicine/repair. 

3) Mecanicum and ""Parent Chapter"" agree to goint venture to create a ""questing successor cheaper"" 

4) Chapter organizes in a Crusading fashion with no home world. 

NOW... 40k lore is so so big, that this has all probably bean done before, both in cannon and in other custom player chapters. But who cares this one is mine. (""This is my rifle, there are many like it, but this one is mine!"") 

Initially I was thinking Blood Angels and having the chapter symbol being a challis (a grail) flanked by ""wings"" made of quarterd sections of the Mechanicum gear symbols.

What other Space marine factions would work well for a ""grail quest"" theme and what groups combat strategies would work best (thematically) with a chapter who were concerned about not accidentally destroying the tech they are fighting to recover?",40k

However, I'm very hesitant to take the plunge for the typical reasons:
a.) it's expensive; and, b.) ... other hang-ups best left unsaid.

I have been painting minis for my D&D games for years and have quite a collection. So much of the ""hidden costs"" like paint & supplies are already spent, although I have yet to and upgrade to an air brush.

So these are my questions.

1) How much do you (you, not people you know) spend on 40k minis and books per year? 
(ball park average, please)

2) How many of the books do you actually need? 
What are those psychic awakening things and to you always need to buy the latest book that touches on your faction.

3) Wats the cheapest path to getting and understanding what you need rules wise? The minimum you need excluding minis, and is it the case that those who do buy supliment rules are at an advantage?

4) How long and how much cash (ball park) did take you to get to your first 2000 point army?

I hope y'all don't mind the questions. Just looking for a sample set to calebrate my expectations.",40k
692,Thoughts on Squat Direction,4,i0oxhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/40k/comments/i0oxhe/thoughts_on_squat_direction/,2,1596154706.0,"I'd love to see the squats return as a stand alone faction and I think there are some good reasons to support this.  First though, I'd like to address the squatting of the squats, wherein they were 'eaten by tyranids'.  Technically it was just a dev throwing a silly reason out there, not an official position.  However, I think canonizing that position would be a good idea.  First it establishes the tyranids more solidly as dangerous creatures.  Second, it gives the squats reason to have disappeared for so long.  I'm going to continue as though the assumption of a canonized nom nom nom of the squat homeworlds is adopted by GW.

First, squat history.  Prior to the Emp's crusade, squats existed very comfortably and as a powerful set of alliances.  They traded with xenos quiet readily, including orkz, eldar, and other minor species.  This gave them incredible advantages, including the eldar bioengineered plants designed to survive on the squats often barren worlds (the plant is important).  These trade relations were so good that the Eldar helped ensure the squats could thrive.

Eventually, and entirely predictably in hindsight, the orkz decided instead of trading with the squats they'd rather just WAAAGH!!! in and take it all.  This was a cross system existential war for the squats.  Strongholds and Leagues fell against the greenskin assault, and as they did so the squats called to their dear allies the eldar for aid.  Instead, they received apathy.  No eldar help came, not supplies, not weapons, not warriors.  Once the squats finally beat the orkz back and purged their spores from the home worlds, the squats became insular, holding a grudge not just against the orkz for attacking but also the eldar for not helping.  They blamed the eldar just as much for inaction as they did the orkz for action.

Following Imperial contact, the Imperium chose not to try to dig the squats out of their deeply entrenched and fortified holes (even though they tried a little bit) and opted to offer full membership in the Imperium to these (technically) abhumans.  The squats got military support and lucrative exclusive trade contracts, which weren't much of a loss because they didn't trust either of the major galactic xenos factions anymore.  Granted, the squats refused the Ecclesiarchy's command that they accept Emperor Worship, and this nearly led to a breakdown of the deal.  A quick save was made by offering that the Emperor watched over the Ancestors, like a guardian angel.  Squats mollified, the Imperium prospered.

This brings me to my point that squats should return as a separate entity, unrelated and opposed to the Imperium.  When, as we canonized earlier, the tyranids landed and scoured the surface of the squat home worlds, the only survivors are the ones who dug deep enough and fortified their holes.  Very few such strongholds and fewer worlds had squats with the right set of conditions for them to avoid consumption.  And there they waited, brooding in darkness, eating the same plant the eldar gave them, hollowing out their underground lairs, trying to reclaim the majesty of their empire in the planet cores.

But why be anti-Imperium?  For the same reason they are anti Eldar, the Imperium did not save them.  As they were systematically targeted by a living xenos weapon, the close trade relations and acquiescence to the Ecclesiarchy's insistence that they submit to the Emperor, even their ancestor spirits, is too much.  The squats have always been true engineers, no machine-spirits or technomancy, they design based on science and engineering and create things better than the Imperium could.  Their advancements underground are bounds ahead of the Imperiums mechanical and electronic witch doctors and they seek to discover if any of their kin survive with powerful communications arrays.

When the squats finally find one another, they should create a new League of all the surviving squats.  The League of Steel, which will not bend knee to nor trust another power other than the squats again.  They have hatred of the Tyranids and Imperium, and slightly less hatred towards the orkz and eldar.  Would they trust the necrons or tau?  Likely not.

I have just got back into WH 40k and bought the prophecy of the wolf box set as I love the wolves and Orkz. 

I wanted to get a 1500 point army (roughly so if its 1750 thats fine)  but with the new rules aI have no idea where to start. 

I want to run Ragnar as his stats are crazy if we get him in close but outside of this I'm back to square one with a list, apart from getting Murderfang or Bjorn!

Has anyone got any suggestions? I was thinking of getting Wulfen, Blood Claws and Thunderwolf cavalry possibly a rune priest.

I've been looking at a number of missions and the fact they are scored in the command phase (at the beginning of the turn) generally seems like an interesting way of doing things... but, I can't see any way in which the player going second can effect the outcome of the game on his 5th turn. Which effectively means he seems to get 1 less turn overall that the player who goes 1st.  


Not only does the player who goes 1st get the opportunity at the beginning of the game to kill enemy units before they have any chance to be used, and establish board control but getting into position 1st. But in the 5th turn of the game they get one more opportunity to destroy the player who goes 2nd units before that player can score a final time while the player who goes second can do nothing in there 5th turn that will effect the outcome of the game in any way (except in the case of some secondaries, but some missions that wont be a thing, such as for Crusade missions). This means over the course of the game the player who goes 1st get 5 opportunities to destroy enemy models before they can score, while the player who goes 2nd only get 4 opportunities to do the same. Is it just me or is missing out on an entire Shooting/Psychic/Attack phase in which to effect the score of the game deeply unfair?  


Just in general, by scoring at the beginning of the round and having no end of game scoring phase turn 5 becomes largely pointless. The game is pretty much effectively already over, except for player 1's bonus round of attempting to deny player 2's last turn of scoring. But but neither player can do anything in round 5 to increase their final Primary score (and in some games that means any and all scoring opportunities.)  


I get that player 2 can attempt to hide on turn 1 and effectively force player 1 to have to be the 1st to extend their army into a position where it is more vulnerable to attack. But you have to have done extremely well hiding your guys to not suffer SOME losses before you can use them, and since player 2 also can't score until they have spent a full turn extended out on those objective it doesn't seem like a huge advantage to me. Especially in light of the fact player 1 is going to get 1 last opportunity to kill your guys in Battleround 5 before they can score and there is nothing you can do to return the favor in that last turn. Secondaries that involving killing shake this up somewhat, but I'm concerned by not enough. It seems to me like having a final turn in which you can do nothing to even try to win in many game will lead to a lot of ""Feels Bad"" moments.

I'm pretty excited to be playing Combat Patrol and Incursion games from home in 9th. So I decided to make myself a bit of a time saver.

Nearly done, at the point where I have to decide if I'm lazy and it's good enough as is, or I add the Line I missed and attempt to paint on the giant circles (6"", 9"", 10"" Diameter) so the design includes every Deployment Zone for Combat Patrol & Incursion (Eternal War & Crusade) missions... or just most of them.

I've heard that even though the Imperium killed quite a few of them defending their planets, they weren't even close to stopping the onslaught.  

I know there are other very powerful factions in this lore but is there any that the Tyranids ""fear"" (if they can even fear something)?  Is there anything that has stood their ground against them?  What about Chaos?  In the lore books is there battles between Necrons and Tyranids? (I googled 'Strongest Faction in 40k' and they mentioned Necrons lol)

I'm still learning more about the lore but so far I can't imagine anything being a threat to this faction.  Anyone know much about this?

I've gotten a great response from the group, just looking to round things out because I really only have one good go at getting an army. It's easier if i just copy paste whats up.

{ So, I really need a hobby right now. I am ""mentally disabled"" if you will (some days) bipolar depression/schizophrenia. I'm heavy quarantined in Louisiana. I have a daughter that I have kept alive four years (Impressive if I do say so myself), but I don't have much to do myself. Outside are people who wont wear masks and are crazy. My income is uhhh limited to say the least. My friend got money for HIS birthday and gave me some to try and raise an army. I have always wanted to play W40k ever since I was a youngster playing W: Dark Omen and Space Hulk on playstation. I am looking for kind souls willing to sell cheap or donate Blood Angel stuff (I guess any spacemarine really), miniature and paint stuff, anything else I might need to live the W40k life if I am actually successful. I really want to paint my dudes into Blood Angels - Angels Penitent Chapter. I need something I can sit and concentrate on just to remove my mind from the crazy world, so I REALLY want to build and paint, uniqueify them and stuff. So that's whats up. }

This is what I have procured:

20 Tactical Marines, 1 deathsquad, 2 dreadnaughts, a slam captain, a librarian on a bike, a heavy weapons squad, 3 scout units, one named guy with a sword, one elite guy with wings, some single marines that have slightly bigger guns.

If anyone can help round this out, I would be immensely grateful. Honestly don't even know what I need 0\_o just points!

So I'm jumping into 40K with the new edition, and had a quick question for you all: I'm pretty sold on Primaris marines of some stripe, but am having trouble figuring out whether to go with normal Space Marines or Space Wolves. Here's my main question: if, looking at the range, I only really like the Primaris Marines and the Primaris Battle Leader and Ragnar, is there any point to my playing space marines? Or should I just use those models as ""normal"" space marines and find a successor chapter or whatever for Space Marines?

Put another way, if I don't really like majority of the Space Wolves-only models, is it worth just using Parimaris marines as a normal marines? Or would a space wolves force of just marines and my aforementioned models still feel different enough? Thanks!",40k

Been a long old while! I'm thinking of getting back into it since a lot of the new mechanics look cool. However, I'd prefer to use old marines since this is what my army is based on and I never really bought into the whole Primaris thing. I just don't rate the new SM models that much.

With that in mind, what legacy marine units are looking good in 9th? For context, I currently have:

* 6 Legion of the Damned (Intending to use these as a command squad inc. Chapter master because of my paint scheme though)
* 1 5-man Terminator squad inc. Termy chaplain
* 1 Librarian
* 1 Captain
* 1 Techmarine (no servitors atm but could easily paint some)
* 3x 5-man Sternguard vets (might turn one of these into a regular joe combat squad)
* 2x Dreadnoughts: 1 vanilla and 1 Ironclad

\--

* 2x 10-man tac squads
* 2x 5-man scout squads (1 bolters, 1 sniper)

\--

* 1 5-man assault squad w/ assault chaplain
* 1 3-bike squadron

\--

* 1 Thunderfire Cannon
* 1 Land Raider Redeemer
* 1 5-man Devastator squad

I also have land speeders, more bikes, more assault dudes, Whirlwind and a Vindicator to paint up. 

Any tips on units I'm missing/should add to get a potentially stronger force on the table? Again, I'm not interested in Primaris - I want to keep the look of this army more or less consistent. 

Cheers!",40k

It's 100% free with no ads.  I'm not trying to make money off of the site, just provide something cool for the community.

It's  a collection of community generated content related to campaigns, scenarios, narrative gaming, and alternate rule sets for tabletop miniature war games.

I  was inspired by some amazing narrative campaign material I found recently.  I realized that there is tons of great content out  there but  that it is scattered across the web, hidden in Facebook groups, and  buried in Reddit.  I created TCRepo to put all of those files in one  location where  they can be browsed, searched, and downloaded by the  community.

The initial  files on the site are what I could find in various Facebook groups I  belong to and through a couple Google searched.  If you think it is  cool, I'd  love to host your content so please send it to me!  You can  contact me  here, at [campaignrepo@gmail.com](mailto:campaignrepo@gmail.com) or through the ""Submit  Content"" link on the site.

I've tried to keep the site generic enough to support all sorts of material  from all sorts  of tabletop games, so please pass along relevant  content even if it isn't for 40k specifically.

My question now is  where should i go from here? do i get terrain and more interesting pieces for the battlefield? wait to get the 9th edition rulebook maybe? I wish i could go to the games workshop near me to ask them in person but i cant go now. So yeah if anyone has some good advice please tell me i would love to hear all of your suggestions. Thank you,40k
